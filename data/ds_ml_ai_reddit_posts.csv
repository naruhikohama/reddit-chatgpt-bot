hiv3vf,MachineLearning,1593547579.0,"It is omnipresent!

**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).

**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.

**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name ""neural"" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the ""godfathers"" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.

**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.

**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.

**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a ""broader impact"" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).

**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.

**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.

Albert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. 

The moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies.

11sboh1,MachineLearning,1678919641.0,"OpenAI was founded for the explicit purpose of democratizing access to AI and acting as a counterbalance to the closed off world of big tech by developing open source tools.

They have abandoned this idea entirely.

Today, with the release of GPT4 and their direct statement that they will not release details of the model creation due to ""safety concerns"" and the competitive environment, they have created a precedent worse than those that existed before they entered the field. We're at risk now of other major players, who previously at least published their work and contributed to open source tools, close themselves off as well.

AI alignment is a serious issue that we definitely have not solved. Its a huge field with a dizzying array of ideas, beliefs and approaches. We're talking about trying to capture the interests and goals of all humanity, after all. In this space, the one approach that is horrifying (and the one that OpenAI was LITERALLY created to prevent) is a singular or oligarchy of for profit corporations making this decision for us. This is exactly what OpenAI plans to do.

I get it, GPT4 is incredible. However, we are talking about the single most transformative technology and societal change that humanity has ever made. It needs to be for everyone or else the average person is going to be left behind.

We need to unify around open source development; choose companies that contribute to science, and condemn the ones that don't.

# But Why?

Like most men, I had the problem of too many women asking for my dick pics.

So I spent the last 2 years learning linear algebra, Bayesian statistics, and multivariable calculus so that I could finally keep up with the demand by generating thousands of fake penises with AI.

The above website features those thousands of penises, do with it what you will.

If you're curious about the machine learning, the training dataset consisted of 40k dick pics from Reddit. Specifically the subreddits: r/penis r/cock, r/dicks, r/averagepenis, r/MassiveCock, and r/tinydick to keep it well rounded.

I then cleaned the dataset by training a Mask R-CNN Model to segment out the penis, used PCA on the segment to find the tilt of the shaft, then rotated the image so the schlong was aligned with the vertical axis.

The images were then put into a [StyleGAN2 ](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)model and trained for \~9 days on a TPUv3-8.

The dataset, in case you want to see what 42,273 dick pics look like is posted in the Github.

A recurrent neural network trained to draw dicks.

Demo: https://dickrnn.github.io/

GitHub: https://github.com/dickrnn/dickrnn.github.io/

This project is a fork of Google's [sketch-rnn demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html). The methodology is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477), and the dataset used for training is based on [Quickdraw-appendix](https://github.com/studiomoniker/Quickdraw-appendix).

# Why?

From Studio Moniker's [Quickdraw-appendix](https://studiomoniker.com/projects/do-not-draw-a-penis) project:

*In 2018 Google open-sourced the [Quickdraw data set](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). “The world's largest doodling data set”. The set consists of 345 categories and over 50 million drawings. For obvious reasons the data set was missing a few specific categories that people seem to enjoy drawing. This made us at Moniker think about the moral reality big tech companies are imposing on our global community and that most people willingly accept this. Therefore we decided to publish an appendix to the Google Quickdraw data set.*

I also believe that [“Doodling a penis is a light-hearted symbol for a rebellious act”](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/17/18681733/google-ai-doodle-detector-penis-protest-moniker-mozilla) and also “think our moral compasses should not be in the hands of big tech”.

umse6v,datascience,1652215748.0,"I have 3 years experience as a Data Analyst and a certificate (not a degree) an online Data Science program. Those are pretty weak credentials, and I'm sure I'm not the only person with that kind of background that starts the job search thinking there's no chance anyone would ever hire me.

I wanted to share what worked for me, just in case it can work for anybody else.

Basically, it's this:

**Treat the job interview like you're selling a service**

What worked for me was to stop thinking of it as a job interview.

Instead, imagine that you're the sales rep for a Data company answering an RFP. A client has a problem and they need a solution. You're just there to demonstrate that you can implement it.

Try to figure out what problem they're trying to solve with this role before the interview begins. That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

Doing this made a *massive* difference in my job search. I didn't hear back from any job I applied to until I tried this approach, but I heard back from everybody after I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/umse6v/i_got_4_data_science_job_offers_with_salaries/,"I got 4 Data Science job offers with salaries between $100k - $150k in a single week, and I have a degree in English Literature",Career,1773,290,0.94

Believe it or not, this algorithm already exists as early as iOS 14.3, hidden under obfuscated class names. After some digging and reverse engineering on the hidden APIs I managed to export its model (which is MobileNetV3) to ONNX and rebuild the whole NeuralHash algorithm in Python. You can now try NeuralHash even on Linux!

Source code: [https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX](https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX)

No pre-exported model file will be provided here for obvious reasons. But it's very easy to export one yourself following the guide I included with the repo above. You don't even need any Apple devices to do it.

Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.

Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it's enabled on all iOS devices.

uyratt,MachineLearning,1653630414.0,"I mean, I trust that the numbers they got are accurate and that they really did the work and got the results. I believe those. It's just that, take the recent ""An Evolutionary Approach to Dynamic Introduction of Tasks in Large-scale Multitask Learning Systems"" paper. It's 18 pages of talking through this pretty convoluted evolutionary and multitask learning algorithm, it's pretty interesting, solves a bunch of problems. But two notes. 

One, the big number they cite as the success metric is 99.43 on CIFAR-10, against a SotA of 99.40, so woop-de-fucking-doo in the grand scheme of things.

Two, there's a chart towards the end of the paper that details how many TPU core-hours were used for just the training regimens that results in the final results. The sum total is 17,810 core-hours. Let's assume that for someone who doesn't work at Google, you'd have to use on-demand pricing of $3.22/hr. This means that these trained models cost $57,348. 

Strictly speaking, throwing enough compute at a general enough genetic algorithm will eventually produce arbitrarily good performance, so while you can absolutely read this paper and collect interesting ideas about how to use genetic algorithms to accomplish multitask learning by having each new task leverage learned weights from previous tasks by defining modifications to a subset of components of a pre-existing model, there's a meta-textual level on which this paper is just ""Jeff Dean spent enough money to feed a family of four for half a decade to get a 0.03% improvement on CIFAR-10.""

OpenAI is far and away the worst offender here, but it seems like everyone's doing it. You throw a fuckton of compute and a light ganache of new ideas at an existing problem with existing data and existing benchmarks, and then if your numbers are infinitesimally higher than their numbers, you get to put a lil' sticker on your CV. Why should I trust that your ideas are even any good? I can't check them, I can't apply them to my own projects. 

Is this really what we're comfortable with as a community? A handful of corporations and the occasional university waving their dicks at everyone because they've got the compute to burn and we don't? There's a level at which I think there should be a new journal, exclusively for papers in which you can replicate their experimental results in under eight hours on a single consumer GPU.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uyratt/d_i_dont_really_trust_papers_out_of_top_labs/,"[D] I don't really trust papers out of ""Top Labs"" anymore",Discussion,1646,265,0.97

I spent the last few years doing web app development. Dug into DL a couple months ago. Supposedly, compared to the post-post-post-docs doing AI stuff, JavaScript developers should be inbred peasants. But every project these peasants release, even a fucking library that colorizes CLI output, has a catchy name, extensive docs, shitloads of comments, fuckton of tests, semantic versioning, changelog, and, oh my god, better variable names than `ctx_h` or `lang_hs` or `fuck_you_for_trying_to_understand`.

The concepts and ideas behind DL, GANs, LSTMs, CNNs, whatever – it's clear, it's simple, it's intuitive. The slog is to go through the jargon (that keeps changing beneath your feet - what's the point of using fancy words if you can't keep them consistent?), the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention.

Sorry for singling out, but [look at this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator/blob/master/src/agent.py) - what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up.

- Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudo-code a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations?

- How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code?

- Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code?

- When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms?

- Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a ""baseline"" TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession?

- Jesus christ, who decided to name a tensor concatenation function `cat`?

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

* WHERE vs. HAVING
* When would you use a subquery? Provide an example
* How would you improve the performance of a slow query?
* EDIT: Some aggregation and GROUP by questions (MAX, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that I just remembered.

**Python**

* Explanation of libraries I use (Pandas mainly)
* How would you get the maximum result from a list?

* What is standard deviation? Examples?
* Difference between STDEV and Variance?
* What statistics do you currently work with? (Descriptive mainly... mean, median, mode, stdev, confidence intervals)

I advanced to round 3 immediately, which is pretty much a shoe-in according to the hiring manager. I am very excited because it seems like a great opportunity. Even if I don't get it, I still felt like I interviewed very well and did my best. I am very proud of myself.

tag8l5,datascience,1646856194.0,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isn’t true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and you’ll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and you’ll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Here’s the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What you’ll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the “what you’ll do” portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that they’re addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a01ac3f299d4630f4fade5870dce3c1ba9851a9

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you don’t. We also want to highlight the ‘preferred’ or ‘nice-to-have’ items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think you’re almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f301bd4619df842700d9ed336f3c9568d36f676c

Make sure to note all these skills you’ve highlighted in the job description down. We’re now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Here’s an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca7ae0c7eb8671e205148f1b776eb35816452080

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you don’t need qualifications for all the requirements. We’re only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects they’ve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employer’s language. So if a job description mentions “QuickBooks,” don’t just say you’ve used “accounting software”.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

You’re a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the company’s mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* What’s the product?
* What’s unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organization’s community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the company’s blog.

Once you’ve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if you’ve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. It’s not mandatory and it’s not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

We’re going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a0c8f638b786b22b37a62a32c7f865889352afa

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66eccd04c188e9c139f22ea2561cc6ee0ab2aa86

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences you’re about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, I’ve helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now I’m excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73b9322c3a07b913065a8cccfaac9d090f44dbb4

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

We’re going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0530da6495dbd9febf710f9bb61f50ebb8a7f8d5

And let’s take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Let’s figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fc1937bd973a6e836e1a1528cd6f18126784b6f

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49a3b9460a7e449e7cb81dd8a00bf7444d1e3ae7

So what we’ve done here is abstracted some themes from this person’s actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34a50751c910936c79ef4ca89e3b529a6062a121

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d0d26fcc0211de29ac7deed3e7821cb812e07b6

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that you’ve got two reasons, it’s time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, I’ve been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the company’s values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you can’t really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why you’re actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think you’ll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, here’s what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=baa8e1eeadfa342f716cd295b0b3243a0c53fc68

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

\*\*\*

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

That means 50% precision, half of the net's contents is junk. You could use a smaller net and target one pocket of the lake where there are lots of fish and no rocks, but you might only get 20 of the fish in order to get 0 rocks. That is 20% recall and 100% precision.

d7ad2y,MachineLearning,1569071811.0,"I'm not a personal follower of Siraj, but this issue came up in a ML FBook group that I'm part of. I'm curious to hear what you all think.

It appears that Siraj recently offered a course ""Make Money with Machine Learning"" with a registration fee but did not follow through with promises made in the initial offering of the course. On top of that, he created a refund and warranty page with information regarding the course *after* people already paid. Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of u/klarken's documentation of Siraj's potential misdeeds: [case for a refund](https://web.archive.org/save/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feedback.html), [discussion in course Discord](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211614/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reference_messages.png), [\~1200 individuals in the course](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211815/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/members.png), [Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211940/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/multiple_slack_channels.png), [""Hundreds refunded""](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923212113/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hundreds_refunded.png)

According to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his Discord/Slack that has been asking for refunds.

On top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot (bottom of post) of an account that has since been deactivated/deleted (he made the account to try and get Siraj's attention). Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed\_query](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed_query). In the search results it is apparent that there are many students who have been impacted by Siraj.

UPDATE 1: Additional searching on Twitter has yielded many more posts, check out the tweets/retweets of these people: [student1](https://web.archive.org/save/https:/twitter.com/ReneeSLiu1) [student2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921133155/https://twitter.com/Aravind56898077)

UPDATE 2: A user mentioned that I should ask a question on r/legaladvice regarding the legality of the refusal to refund and whatnot. I have done so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d7gopa/independent_online_course_false_advertising_and/). It appears that per California commerce law (where the School of AI is registered) individuals have the right to ask for a refund for 30 days.

UPDATE 3: Siraj has replied to the post below, and on [Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922213957/https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1175864213916372992?s=09) (Way Back Machine capture)

UPDATE 4: Another student has shared their interactions via [this Imgur post](https://imgur.com/gallery/msAdqBn). And another recorded moderators actively suppressing any mentions of refunds [on a live stream](https://web.archive.org/save/https://imgur.com/a/o1TMRY2).

wiqjxv,MachineLearning,1659907526.0,"I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I’ve felt I’ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express – and I know I can’t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI – Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. – would think if they could see the state of AI that we’ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn’t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution – bias, racism, malicious use, etc. – for purposes that who asked for?

When I started my career as an AI/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks – 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I’m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons – forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it’s getting harder and harder.

This is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows’s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization – art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves – the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won’t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn’t exist.

Almost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you’re an artist or writer and you’re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to “enhance” your work, or if you’re a programmer saying, “GitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?”, then how could you possibly know? You’ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can’t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.

When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking – that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren’t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of – if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there’s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won’t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn’t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).

Furthermore, I’ve yet to set anyone discuss the train – generate – train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?

By relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I’m convinced that we as AI/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we’ve made, as well as a prisoner’s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we’ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it – our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.

If you’re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you’ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You’re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it’s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you’re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you’re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team’s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can’t – the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you’re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.

Even assuming that none of what I’ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I’m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I’d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn’t as demoralizing as I’ve made it out to be.

EDIT: Day after posting this -- this post took off way more than I expected. Even if I received 20 - 25 comments, I would have considered that a success, but this went much further. Thank you to each one of you that has read this post, even more so if you left a comment, and triply so for those who gave awards! I've read almost every comment that has come in (even the troll ones), and am truly grateful for each one, including those in sharp disagreement. I've learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives. While I will try to reply as many comments as I can, the sheer comment volume combined with limited free time between work and family unfortunately means that there are many that I likely won't be able to get to.

p7hpd9,datascience,1629388865.0,"I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon.

The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

It is related to a few previous popular posts on this subreddit with high upvotes, which prompted me to post this [story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/).

The **[story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/)** reports the details of a new leak of highly classified Chinese government documents reveals the operations manual for running the mass detention camps in Xinjiang and exposed the mechanics of the region’s system of mass surveillance.

**The [lead journalist](https://twitter.com/BethanyAllenEbr/status/1198663008152621057)'s summary of findings**

The China Cables represent the first leak of a classified Chinese government document revealing the inner workings of the detention camps, as well as the first leak of classified government documents unveiling the predictive policing system in Xinjiang.

The leak features classified intelligence briefings that reveal, in the government’s own words, how Xinjiang police essentially take orders from a massive “cybernetic brain” known as IJOP, which flags entire categories of people for investigation & detention.

These secret intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s AI-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on computer-generated findings alone. The result? Arrest by algorithm.

**The article describe methods used for algorithmic policing**

The classified intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s artificial-intelligence-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on these computer-generated findings alone. Experts say the platform, which is used in both policing and military contexts, demonstrates the power of technology to help drive industrial-scale human rights abuses.

“The Chinese [government] have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data run through artificial intelligence and machine learning that they can, in fact, predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place, as well as identify possible populations that have the propensity to engage in anti-state anti-regime action,” said Mulvenon, the SOS International document expert and director of intelligence integration. “And then they are preemptively going after those people using that data.”

In addition to the predictive policing aspect of the article, there are side [articles](https://qz.com/1755018/chinas-manual-for-uighur-detention-camps-revealed-in-data-leak/) about the entire ML stack, including how [mobile apps](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/) are used to target Uighurs, and also how the inmates are [re-educated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) once inside the concentration camps. The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled.

*Note: My motivation for posting this story is to raise ethical concerns and awareness in the research community. I do not want to heighten levels of racism towards the Chinese research community (not that it may matter, but I am Chinese). See this [thread](https://redd.it/e10b5x) for some context about what I don't want these discussions to become.*

*I am aware of the fact that the Chinese government's policy is to integrate the state and the people as one, so accusing the party is perceived domestically as insulting the Chinese people, but I also believe that we as a research community is intelligent enough to be able to separate government, and those in power, from individual researchers. We as a community should keep in mind that there are many Chinese researchers (in mainland and abroad) who are not supportive of the actions of the CCP, but they may not be able to voice their concerns due to personal risk.*

**Edit** Suggestion from /u/DunkelBeard:

When discussing issues relating to the Chinese government, try to use the term CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government, or Beijing. Try *not* to use only the term *Chinese* or *China* when describing the government, as it may be misinterpreted as referring to the Chinese people (either citizens of China, or people of Chinese ethnicity), if that is not your intention.

Their post gathered thousands of reactions, and the candidate was quick to recruit branding, marketing, frontend, and backend developers for the project. Heaps of praise all around. He listed himself as a Director of XXXX (redacted), the new name for his project. 

The accuracy was based on a training dataset of ~30 images of lesion / healthy lungs, sharing of data between test / train / validation, and code to train ResNet50 from a PyTorch tutorial.   Nonetheless, thousands of reactions and praise from the “AI | Data Science | Entrepreneur” community. 

**Original Post:**

I saw this post circulating on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6645711949554425856-9Dhm

Here, a PhD candidate claims to achieve great performance with “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” to predict coronavirus, asks for more help, and garners tens of thousands of views. The repo housing this ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE solution already has a backend, front end, *branding*, a README translated in 6 languages, and a call to spread the word for this wonderful technology. Surely, I thought, this researcher has some great and novel tech for all of this hype? I mean dear god, we have *branding*, and the author has listed himself as the *founder of an organization* based on this project. Anything with this much attention, with dozens of “AI | Data Scientist | Entrepreneur” members of LinkedIn praising it, must have some great merit, right? 

Lo and behold, we have ResNet50, from torchvision.models import resnet50, with its linear layer replaced. We have a training dataset of 30 images. This should’ve taken at MAX 3 hours to put together - 1 hour for following a tutorial, and 2 for obfuscating the training with unnecessary code. 

I genuinely don’t know what to think other than this is bonkers. I hope I’m wrong, and there’s some secret model this author is hiding? If so, I’ll delete this post, but I looked through the repo and (REPO link redacted) that’s all I could find. 

I’m at a loss for thoughts. Can someone explain why this stuff trends on LinkedIn, gets thousands of views and reactions, and gets loads of praise from “expert data scientists”? It’s almost offensive to people who are like ... actually working to treat coronavirus and develop real solutions. It also seriously turns me off from pursuing an MS in CV as opposed to CS.

Edit: It turns out there were duplicate images between test / val / training, as if ResNet50 on 30 images wasn’t enough already. 

He’s also posted an update signed as “Director of XXXX (redacted)”. This seems like a straight up sleazy way to capitalize on the pandemic by advertising himself to be the head of a made up organization, pulling resources away from real biomedical researchers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fni5ow/d_why_is_the_ai_hype_absolutely_bonkers/,[D] Why is the AI Hype Absolutely Bonkers,Discussion,1103,226,0.98

What I’ve found since getting into big tech as a # Data Scientist (if you listen to music odds are you use my company’s product) is that 99.99% of the skills involved are: 

- SQL

- grade school math/algebra 

- common sense to apply SQL results to business questions 

- presentation/communication skills 

My current TC is 300k (205k base) and I have yet to need anything fancier than a bar graph or a line chart. Yes there’s teams internally that use much more advanced math/causal inference, but for the majority of folks browsing here and looking for a career path, you’re over complicating things. 

I wonder why so many online look down at pseudo data analyst roles when they can have just as big of an impact as your cutting edge ML folks internally by convincing the CEO to cut/launch a product, and the pay is more than enough to live off of.

I’m on the interview panel for senior/staff DS and frequently get PHDs from top schools who don’t pass the bar because they can’t answer basic business case questions and can’t write basic SQL.

nue01q,datascience,1623076428.0,"I honestly, don't think people wanting to break into Data Science really know what all it entails. It just sounds good, and sounds like it will make them lots of money.

No one tells people what comes with the job. There are a lot of headaches that come with it, and you have to be a very patient person.

When any person starts out in IT, they learn some psychology. How to manage users and their expectations. You learn what to say and what not to say. You learn how to appear confident and reassuring even if you're getting up to speed in the moment. The good ones do anyway.

Data Science, BI, DA - you have to have those skills multiplied by ten. You have to be better than the rest at managing expectations. You have to learn how to avoid support drains, and be thinking ahead all of the time.

The data science people are the only people I respect as much as the people in Systems. Because other fields, you learn one thing and only one side of it, call yourself an engineer despite knowing one side. Sys Engineers have to know a little about everything and base knowledge in all kinds of things/ They are constantly growing. Data Science folks are similar because they have to know a wide assortment of things, and they have to know all of the tips and tricks at their disposal to get their desired result. Which means they will know Python, multiple types of SQL, Pandas, Jupyter, and so on. They'll pivot in Excel in a pinch if they need to.

But the main reason I respect them is just because of how patient they have to be to want to work in their field for 30+ years.

Our DA left in 2018 and one of my roles was a senior DBA, so they just put her job on top of mine. I learned a lot and I got very good at SQL and streamlining and reducing task turn around for reports and data tasks. But I obviously didn't have the time to dive ultra deep into the rabbit hole, and I didn't want to. Because I knew it wasn't for me.

We were acquired, and I transitioned all of that stuff onto the BI team of the new company. I have so much respect for those people. I am still answering questions and taking one off requests. This morning I was just hit in the face with how much I dislike actually doing he DS/DA side. A Sales Senior Manager needed something with some data. I asked a follow up question. I needed a key piece of info to ensure I did the right thing and didn't have to do re work later. They said they would get it to me later.

They emailed it to me at 7:11am this morning, then messaged me before my shift - ""Hey, I don't see the data task with the blah blah being done. We needed it 6/3."" And I am thinking - then why wait until 6/7 to give me the info. We got the request 6/4, and I asked you on 6/4, then you waited the weekend to get it to me.

And those individuals who just keep coming back telling you the data wasn't what they expected or wanted when it is what they asked for.. I'm so happy to be just a senior sys engineer again working on large scale infra.

It's not for everyone, and I think they need to talk about and teach managing expectations so you don't shoot yourself in the foot. Luckily the BI team of the new company are phenomenal, and now I am out of the game. 

But I am learning more Python at home in my spare time and things like Jupyter so I don't regress skill wise. Python is useful in what I do anyway. I've rewritten several PS automation scripts in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nue01q/data_science_and_data_analytics_is_becoming_ultra/,"Data Science and Data Analytics is becoming ultra glorified / romanticized, and I don't think people are really told what they are getting into.",Discussion,1062,189,0.96

Hey gang, stand back, it’s rant time. 

Analytics is a new field at my work, and I’m here to pioneer it. I work In corporate at a large medical devices company. 

I’ve had the luxury of an amazing boss, some amazing colleagues, and decent budget. 

But for the love of fucking god... I am so sick of being thrown responsibility or projects because good ol mary in sales watched a video on “gesture recognition”. The ideas are a great, and I have a framework for filtering them, but the fucking pressure, the initiation of projects with 0 data, no aim at data collection, no quality assurance or risk management and the icing on the cake, “we should roll out an MVP in 2 months”. What in gods name is that shit? 

I’m the asshole. I’m always the asshole. 
“Here are my requirements if we wish to complete this project in the given time frame.” 
“So... why can’t you develop it now?”
Bro... for starters, I’m not a full fledged software engineer / deep learning god.

lkn4rl,datascience,1613423073.0,"I've been working as a Data Scientist long enough to say that asking Leetcode questions for Data Scientists is completely disrespectful. This is both for both product and ML-based data scientists.

Something simple is fine, like hashmaps, two pointers, strings, some light algorithms etc. But graph theories, DFS with trees/dynamic programming has nothing to do with data analytics, ML fundamentals, statistical foundations, and data storytelling competence.

I really don't understand. When you have a wealth of ways to distinguish competent Data Scientists from juniors during interview pipeline (complicated SQL, pandas, data munging, visualization, ML training, building simulation code, etc.), why you'd rather choose questions like ""how many moves do you need to get a Queen chess piece from this position to another on a chessboard"" as a way of measuring how well a Data Scientist would perform analytics or ML training on the job. It really just feels like SWEs making fun of Data Scientists about how poor programmers we are.

Most companies don't pull crap like this, but for those who do, PLEASE STOP. Unless we received a BA or MA in computer science -- which majority if not most of us did not -- we won't be able to solve shit like this unless we cheat and look at answers directly on leetcode or geekforgeeks. And it's infuriating and embarrassing for us to sink to this kind of level to solve questions that aren't meant for us. I get that Data people need to know programming, but WE AREN'T SWEs, and DS is not SWE.

**Edit**: I'm getting a lot of replies saying that I suck at programming and I need to learn SWE fundamentals. I said over and over that I'm not against understanding foundations of SWE (hashmaps, runtime, pointers, optimized solutions vs brute force). These are important. But when you get into highly niched algorithm named after somebody where you need to do some complicated tricks or build a whole system that requires multiple functions, DFS-based dynamic programming, multiple inheritance methods all in 45 minutes that would unnerve even seasoned SWEs out of practice, that's when it becomes totally unreasonable, outside the realm of data science, and just disrespectful to what Data Scientists do on a daily basis. But that's the line I draw, and the overall question is: at what point do interview questions become unjustifiable and unrelated to the position at hand? I've spent years using pandas, scikit-learn, tableau, and complicated SQL for daily data tasks. Why is it that you can't test me on this stuff which occurs on day-to-day basis for majority of data scientists?

**Edit Edit:** Btw, shame on those of you just downvoting everything I'm saying without reading any of it (I can't even locate my own comments anymore). It's immature and completely ridiculous.

k7iytr,datascience,1607213572.0,"I graduated this year with a masters of statistics. In this article, I will explain the process that ultimately led to my offer for a **Senior Data Scientist ** position for a company in the SF Bay Area. The components of the process that led to my success, in no particular order, were: crafting my resume and LinkedIn, building skills and projects, staying motivated (during the pandemic), decoding the data science interview process, and determining my professional goals.

(**EDIT // Important Note: this is not big N or FAANG, since in the comments people are using top top companies to benchmark my experience**)

## Preface 

As with any statistical inference, a singleton dataset won't yield robustness. I was an unusual applicant to my grad program, and am an unorthodox candidate for DS roles, which is why it took me six months to find a job while my peers all had several offers immediately following graduation (and some months in advance!). I worked for 6 years between my undergrad and masters in the nonprofit world and had many different job titles, as noted in Edit #2 below. Coming back to school was a huge pivot and career shift, and so I am extremely fortunate to have found a firm who recognized the unique strengths I bring to the table; I was also extremely fortunate to interact with this firm at the right time where my unique strength combination was part of their strategic plan. 

**Takeaway:** My experience is not a modal experience, but the tools I used and the lessons I learned may be useful for others. I would have appreciated reading it two years ago, so I'm putting it here in case others relate. Also a friendly reminders to aspiring or current data scientists not to conflate [prior and posterior probabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/posterior-probability.asp).

## Crafting My Resume and LinkedIn

I completely botched my first DS resume. I borrowed a classmate's resume and used it as a template, and tried to copy what they had done. But they had internships, relevant projects, and a better GPA than me, so my version looked... weird, since I didn't have any of those things. Also, I was still expecting people to ""read between the lines"" on my resume instead of being as clear as possible. I started applying and connecting with folks, and what I am shocked by is that **not one person I asked about my resume gave substantial or useful feedback**. The one useful piece of feedback that I received was from my parents, who remarked ""this doesn't seem to really sell you; you're much better in person than on this paper."" While initially, I was resistant to rehauling my resume, I decided to spend a full week almost full time rehauling my resume. This paid off, because I saw a significant uptick in responses and was able to get several first round interviews. The main changes I made:

- Only put what is relevant to the role you are applying for. Even though I had some impressive accomplishments from other projects or roles, I chose the projects or skills that were relevant to data science. 
- Similar to the [first rule of road-side beet sales](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/3d/b6/193db68d6c65ce5881edcbd84c1e436c.jpg), I put my best features in the top half of my resume. 
- I used Canva to make a visually appealing resume, and later switched to a LaTeX resume template to make my resume more professional looking. This was a very very good decision, and I got so much positive feedback from recruiters and hiring managers after making that change. 
- I used a LaTeX cover letter template to write cover letters, which made it look very official and professional. It was easier to produce because I could just make a new document in overleaf and change small portions in the letter, since it's mostly common across applications, and once you do enough you have even domain specific and role specific letters ready to go.

**Takeaway:** your image matters a lot. Make sure to craft it carefully, and tailor it for roles that you are really interested in. 

## Building Skills and Projects

My strategy for learning something is spend at least a week or two finding the best resource, then pay whatever it costs (in your budget) and use it 100%. Don't find 16 free cheat sheets and ""shortcuts"". I researched every resource I could find (many thanks to r/datascience, r/machinelearning, and r/cscareersquestions) and I tried out a few, but saw that many only give free temporary access to some subsection of the entire platform, so you can't really explore past the first few questions or modules. However, I saw a reddit post talking about some site called [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) where they gave you 7 days for free, but it was full access. I looked through the catalogue and found a lot of what I wanted to learn. I took a week and devoted 8 hours per day to going through the modules. There are some things I would change, but for the most part, it is very well designed, and extremely helpful. I earned somewhere around 20K ""experience"" on the platform, which means I finished \~100-200 exercises from data engineering, modeling, or reviewing OOP in Python. Then at the end of the free trial, they emailed me a 62% coupon for a year's subscription, which brought it down to an insanely reasonable number, like between 100-150 bucks? Easy decision, since I had already mapped my curriculum through the rest of their materials, and they have new courses coming out every 1-2 weeks. 

For textbooks, anything from O'Reily with an animal on the front is probably going to be a good resource. I burned through about a half dozen of those books, taking notes and building the example projects, then moving to DataCamp to do similar projects, then once I felt confident, I would find a dataset from Kaggle or the UCI ML repo and try to carry out the steps, then benchmark my findings with some medium article where someone did the same thing. **Try to keep projects at the center of your learning, then find materials that will add to the project.** This is much more transferrable to a job, and learning to think in this way will help you in interviews. 

I saw an instagram account I follow put out a survey and was getting a lot of responses, but the way they were reporting the data was not able to do full justice to the story they were trying to tell. So I reached out and asked if I could take a look, and they were super excited to have someone with experience weigh in. So I ended up getting a few different spreadsheets, some with categorical and quantitative data and some categorical, while one of the responses was meant for a massively long response (Some users inputted over 1000 words). Do you see where this is going? It's basically a playground where my boss has 0 expectations and all I have to do is improve on autogenerated excel charts. I began cleaning the data in a notebook, then built a set of scripts, then loaded a database, then made a dashboard for the team (using a python flask app), and scheduled cron jobs to extract the data and report results to the ceo/founder of this nonprofit. Every new DataCamp module I completed was one more secret to the puzzle of how to present and improve the data visuals, process, and my code. I got invited to meetings with the other leaders, asked about business decisions, and got to be part of the real life cycle of their mission. 

Now that I had a taste of what that looked like, I reached out to my gym; they keep all of their members data on lifting progress and workout goals in an app, and I was able to give them a fun graphic and report for their members, and they shared on social media and saw an uptick in new memberships! I considered packaging this ""product"" and emailing other gyms, but I got overwhelmed by the pandemic/election and decided to put extra stuff on the back burner and wait for later when I have more skills. 

**Takeaway:** make your learning project driven, and document your entire project, including packaging in several different formats, making a clear write-up, and versions of a verbal explanation that take 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 20 minutes. Then, explain it for a PhD, a CEO, a peer, and a non-technical client (or whatever audiences you want, provided they vary by technical understanding and business investment). Try to carry every project through the finish line. As an example, this post/article is my way of compiling a high-level overview of the job search process--the ""finish line"" of this 6 month project.


## Decoding the Data Science Interview Process

Have you ever been invited to church by your friend, but they didn't explain anything before you got there? You don't know when to raise your hands, or to stand up or sit down, or why the man up front is yelling? That's how I felt for the last 6 months. From when you're supposed to negotiate salary, wtf a ""first year cliff"" is, or what you're allowed to ask and to whom, nobody teaches you this stuff. Why does everything have to be so goddamned awkward and needlessly confusing? I have teaching experience so all of this infuriated me as a very eager learner. 

There are two kinds of people you will encounter: 
- Those who pretend to know the answer, and give you bullshit advice or project onto your experience
- Those who know the answer, but don't know how to explain it, or give equally useless advice like ""just keep applying"". 

Nobody will tell you the truth to your face, or give you meaningful feedback of any kind, and I asked for it *constantly*. They will send you a form email, ghost you, or dodge your questions and judge you for breaking  etiquette **you have no idea about**. 

### My Process

I decided to submit some applications on Linkedin every other day as a benchmark, and took advantage of the ""Easy Apply"" feature to get more applications out. There is a tradeoff between quality and quantity in the applications you send out. Aside from more applications going out, I needed more information, so I decided to use my network to do some decoding.

I went on Facebook, IG, and my LinkedIn and filtered by software, data, CS, analyst etc until I had a list of people to ask questions to. I contacted each of them and asked for a brief phone call to get their advice and to hear about their experience in role R at company C. Here are examples of the questions I asked:

- What are your career goals and how have they changed?
- What are some of the important technologies or libraries to be fluent in as a [their role / your desired role]?
- What helps a candidate stand out when you’re selecting for promotion or advancement?
- What is the culture of [their company] in terms of work / life balance and expectations?
- What does a normal day / week look like?
- What do teams look like and how are projects carried out?
- In risk analytics / Risk dynamics, what are the industry tools?
- For risk analytics, what are differentiators in top analysts?
- What is the culture like?

The final question I always ask is: 

- How do internal referrals work and would you be willing to submit one on my behalf?

I got some first round interviews or conversations with recruiters through this method, but none of the connections panned out, and I only got one technical interview, which was a coding challenge that I answered 5/6 correct, so was not invited to the next round. 

Now that I had exhausted my first round connections, it was time to go to strangers. I went to company pages on LinkedIn and clicked ""people"" and filtered by Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer, then reached out with the following message:

> Subject Line: **[Fellow University Alum]\* wondering about [Company]**
>
>Hey [name], 
>
>My name is [name] and I just finished up at [school] with an [degree] in [major]! I have a background in [sub-filed] and love what I have seen in the job descriptions at [company], and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind connecting and answering some questions I have about the data scientist role and how your experience has been. Thanks so much for your time!
>
>Best, 
>[name]

\* replace ""Fellow University Alum"" with whatever way you can connect with the person based on their profile. Otherwise just say ""Aspiring Data Scientist"" or something humble and eager.

I got several interviews and referrals from strangers this way. 


**Takeaway:** use your network and reach out to make as many connections as possible in order to learn more about what you want or don't want. They may also be happy to refer you to a position.

## Determining My Professional Goals

I interviewed for the following positions: Intern, Research Associate, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Analyst, Analyst, Consultant, Product Manager, and others. 

I talked to a lot of people and wanted to understand what motivates them, what they are experiencing in their role, and what they hope for in the future. What skills do they have, and are those skills transferrable? It seems to me that coding practices and statistical intuition are very transferrable, and so I wanted a role that would allow me to improve those two things. I want to be able to transfer what I learn in my next role to future roles, and I'm not attached to any particular industry. So it was important for me to distinguish myself from those who love coding, or those who want a 9-5 without much challenge, or those who want to do analyst work but don't want to become leaders. Benchmarking and measuring your goals and feelings against others similar to you but in different roles and spaces is an excellent way to figure out what you want to do, and even what size of company you prefer. 

My set of values pre-job offer:

- Any size company, but prefer a medium team size, and a company without too much bureaucracy. 
- Exposure to ML as well as data-wrangling, without too much emphasis on one vs. the other. 
- If I can mentor or help more junior developers, I would enjoy that.
- Have an enjoyable connection to other employees during the interview process.
- If possible, a company that has a meaningful contribution to society, or positive local impact.
- Being able to bring my ideas and whole self to the job, not just a clock-in clock-out situation. 


**Takeaway:** find out what positions interest you, and try to craft your profile, projects, and skills to fit that role. Don't be afraid to say no to positions if they don't meet your criteria.

## Staying Motivated

The 2020 turbulence shook everything that wasn't securely tied down. I've spent much of my free time on calls with friends and family about navigating the challenges they are facing this year. I had weekends and whole weeks where I didn't do anything except scroll on reddit, tiktok, IG, etc. and felt like shit. I had other weeks where I felt like a superhero, learning things and gaining confidence, getting a website to work, debugging part of a data pipeline, etc. Here are the things that helped me stay on track:

- Getting enough nutrients and listening to my body's caloric needs.
- Stretching and foam-rolling when I feel stiff or uncomfortable sitting all day.
- Lifting weights or going for a walk.
- Taking one or two weeks to stop applying because of rejection fatigue.
- Scheduling phone calls with other people in the same boat to commiserate.
- Watching stand up comedy on youtube to crack up and laugh to break the day's tension.
- Limiting doom scrolling and hyper vigilance (our house was 2 miles from one of the fires, so that was hard).
- Any time I needed a nap, I took that nap. 
- Unfollow anything that isn't encouraging, uplifting, or useful to me in this period of time.

## Giving Back

I was SO LONELY on this journey, and resources on Reddit have helped me massively. As a way to give back to the community, I want to offer the following things for free: 

- A 10-15 minute zoom call to advise you or answer your questions about how to get the Data Science job you're looking for (limited to how many I can fit in next week and who is in dire need). 
- A tailored response to your personal question or situation via email, or advice on how to improve your resume.
- A follow up post on this subreddit answering the top several questions I get.
- Answering as many questions in the comments as I can. I'll reply [""pass""](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-pass-statement-in-python) in some cases, or refer you to resources that were useful to me. 

**Update: Survey now closed. See Edit #5.** 

**Edit #1**: Formatting, added link to [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

**Edit #2:** It's an important note that I worked for 6 years in the nonprofit world before coming back to school. Here's a quote from one of my responses below: 
>""I worked in the nonprofit world and had a lot of different roles and responsibilities, including working abroad in a humanitarian capacity, translating for conferences, logistics and operations, participating in making curriculum for staff and volunteers, casting vision to donors in a fund-development capacity, etc. I wish it were a one-liner 'I worked in software' that would be satisfying or succinct, but it is simply more complicated.""

**Edit #3:** Some people are suggesting that my offers to have a zoom call or offer resume feedback are part of some nefarious ploy to obtain people's information or manipulate them in some way. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know that there are firms who have been scraping employment data from before the sites had adequate protections in place? I interacted with one such company over the course of my research. It would probably be more efficient for me to make a [LinkedIn Recruiter Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a417020/personal-account-vs-recruiter?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Recruiter%20is%20a%20talent,of%20active%20and%20passive%20candidates.). Then I could have thousands of emails and LinkedIn profiles all for my nefarious purposes! Muahahahaha! For more stories of recruiting shenanigans, check out r/recruitinghell for best practices. Relevant quote from one of my comments below:
> Hey! I made an edit about this. I had hoped to have some verbal conversations if people were interested, since I have a track record of coaching younger students, teaching, and mentorship. It was the first way I could think to give back to this community aside from writing more posts (which I could certainly do). Is there a method you would suggest that might help that come through more effectively? I definitely don't want to send the wrong message. Thanks!

**Edit #4:** Added Preface section to better contextualize my story.

**Edit #5:** I have closed the survey and will be turning off notifications for this post, following up with the folks who filled out the survey, and writing follow up posts if I get feedback that it will be useful. Thanks to all of you for celebrating with me and helping me make sure this post is as useful for the community as possible! I also received some rather hateful messages, and people disbelieving my story and hard work. I am flattered by your disbelief, because it underscores how incredible my journey has been!

“168 applications, 39 of which I sent with the masculine named resume. Dude I’m not trying to prove/debate gender discrimination in this post. Just let the fellow wistem homies know this is a possible help for them in tough times for everyone.” 

Out of the latter 39 applications I got 3 interviews (in my desired industry), 2 offers and accepted 1. In the first 129 I only got 1 interview in my desired field. There were a handful of others interview calls for roles outside my industry.

hzdiru,MachineLearning,1595938168.0,"TL;DR: The only thing worse than not providing code is saying you did and not following through.

I'm frustrated, so this might be a little bit of a rant but here goes: I cannot believe that it is acceptable in highly ranked conferences to straight-up lie about the availability of code. Firstly, obviously it would be great if everyone released their code all the time because repeatability in ML is pretty dismal at times. But if you're not going to publish your code, then don't say you are. Especially when you're leaving details out of the paper and referring the reader to said ""published"" code.

Take for example [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04725), coming out of NVIDIA's research lab and published in CVPR2020. It is fairly detail-sparse, and nigh on impossible to reproduce in its current state as a result. It refers the reader to [this repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/wetectron) which has been a single readme since its creation. It is simply unacceptable for this when the paper directly says the code has been released.

As top conferences are starting to encourage the release of code, I think there needs to be another component: the code must actually be available. Papers that link to empty or missing repositories within some kind of reasonable timeframe of publication should be withdrawn. It should be unacceptable to direct readers to code that doesn't exist for details, and similarly for deleting repositories shortly after publication. I get that this is logistically a little tough, because it has to be done after publication, but still we can't let this be considered okay

EDIT: To repeat the TL;DR again and highlight the key point - There won't always be code, that's frustrating but tolerable. There is no excuse for claiming to have code available, but not actually making it available. Code should be required to be up at time of publication, and kept up for some duration, if a paper wishes to claim to have released their code.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hzdiru/d_if_you_say_in_a_paper_you_provide_code_it/,"[D] If you say in a paper you provide code, it should be required to be available at time of publication",Discussion,952,143,0.97

I got my 1st job after graduating with 2 internships under my belt. I felt I was ready to take on the world.

I started to work for a start up, I moved countries, I was really excited about it but apparently I couldn't present results fast enough or accurate enough.

I always like to assume responsibility, as it is the only way to growth.

On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables, PMs told me to work with those tables, but those were the wrong tables. I eventually found that I had to request special access to my department's tables... and for some reason those tables were hidden from general view...

2nd and 3rd months I was working with SQL+JSON tables plus all the side tasks. Apparently I did not manage to fully understand the concept of SQL + JSON very well. My numbers were always wrong.

The pandemic hasn't been kind to me (and many others, I know) my focus hasn't been what is used to be, I feel slower, less energetic and less smart.. And the other day I was sent by back to my country, yesterday I broke up with a girl I was seeing... Everything sucks at the moment.

I am not really sure what to do. I like SQL, I like helping business making sense of data, I like doing ad-hocs projects in R or Python. Or at least I thought I did...

I am starting to doubt myself, I feel I am not good enough and that Data might not be for me...

I am sure things will get better, but right now they suck very much.

Trying to do you all a service without it backfiring. [https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0](https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0) I do want to mention that just DOING interviews made me better. My first interviews were a train-wreck. By the end, I felt like an interview expert.

For context, I am 23yo from the US. I have a Math degree from a no-name university, I have taken 0 bootcamps, and I have only taken intro coding courses. I also have some statistics courses under my belt. I have 1 year of relevant work experience and some projects. Let me not undersell myself, but I am far from an expert-level candidate and I have minimal experience.

Here are my tips for getting an interview and job when you're competing with 100s of candidates that all might have more work experience and advanced degrees.

I must first put out that I am a man of faith, so I give God credit. But after that, here are my tips:

**You need a GREAT resume.**

You are competing with advanced degrees and people who probably have much more experience than you. You cannot get away with a bad resume, you simply will be denied immediately. You must do the following:

* Quantify what you did, and how it impacted the business.
* USE KEYWORDS. I don't care if you just touched Keras, put it somewhere on your resume. Some are against this, but use a Skills section at the bottom to include the keywords and then also include them in your highlights. You're looking to at least get an HR interview, your resume will get you there.
* Find a really good-looking template that stands out. Not color, but with formatting.

**Apply Everywhere**

For me, I used LinkedIn exclusively. I did not apply to anything that made me do much more than submit a resume. Its not worth your time. In my experience, take-home coding tests are only worth your time if you've done a series of interviews, it takes 3 hours or less and, the company has shown interest as well.

* Apply even if you're not qualified (not horribly unqualified though). There's flexibility in YOE. I actually got a job interview with somewhere asking for a Masters and 8+ YOE.

**STUDY UP**

* Understand basic statistics. Seriously. Be able to explain every way you'd perform a test and why. What would you do with unbalanced data? Etc.
* Be able to explain a model thoroughly, why would you use it? I was asked to explain loss, variance, bias, what loss function I might use, etc.
* Practice your coding, most of these are in Python
* You must know SQL, preferably advanced-level. I had more SQL coding questions than anything else.

**KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER**

* They WILL ask you case-study questions. You must be able to think outside the box.
* Act super-enthused about their position, even if you are applying elsewhere and its not your #1

**DON'T GIVE UP**

* I submitted easily over 200 applications, received calls on maybe 20 of them, got to the final interviews on 7, was denied on 5, and offered 2.

**MISTAKES I MADE**

* Not remembering my basic statistics, I actually messed up on one interview about ""How would you describe a p-value to a non-technical audience.""
* Not being able to communicate how my projects impacted the company. I have good project experience, but for my first final interview, I had a lot of trouble trying to explain the business impact and how I solved issues. These need to be fresh in your mind.
* Not acting interested. I had at one time, 5 different companies interviewing me and I didn't have much energy to care about each one. This ruined a few of my chances.
* Not studying on the work department. If you are applying to a marketing position, understand a little about marketing... They chose another candidate when I likely would have been chosen had I known a little more background knowledge.

di2fez,MachineLearning,1571112550.0,"*According to article in [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/14/ravel_ai_youtube/)*:

A Netflix spokesperson confirmed to The Register it wasn’t working with Raval, and the ESA has cancelled the whole workshop altogether.

“The situation is as it is. The workshop is cancelled, and that’s all,” Guillaume Belanger, an astrophysicist and the INTEGRAL Science Operations Coordinator at the ESA, told The Register on Monday.

Raval isn’t about to quit his work any time soon, however. He promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at Nvidia, Intel, Google and Amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client.

In an unlisted YouTube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by El Reg, he read out a question posed to him: “Will your referrals hold any value now?”

“Um, yeah they’re going to hold value. I don’t see why they wouldn’t. I mean, yes, some people on Twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with… I mean… I’ve also had tons of support, you know. I’ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies.

*He continues to justify his actions:*

“Public figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. You know, people make mistakes. You just have to keep going. They’re basically just telling me to not to stop. Of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,” he claimed.

*When The Register asked Raval for comment, he responded:*

**I've hardly taken any time off to relax since I first started my YouTube channel almost four years ago. And despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, I progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself – a book, a docu-series, podcasts, YouTube videos, the course, the school of AI. Basically, these past few weeks, I've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything I've felt before. As a result, all of my output has been subpar.**

**I made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. I remember wishing I had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself I couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. I plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. The associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. I didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, I considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. If I had a second chance, I'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.**

**I've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course. There are many happy students, they're just not as vocal on social media. We're on week 8 of 10 of my course, fully committed to student success.**

“And, no, I haven't plagiarized research for any other paper,” he added.

This week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [How visual search works](https://thomasdelteil.github.io/VisualSearch_MXNet/) and other about [generating ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8l5w56/p_generative_ramen/). The former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a GAN. The irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of GAN can make one). Today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating GAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8mgs8k/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. Are you seeing a pattern here?

The problem I mentioned above is not a one of case, I am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months I started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. People who posts gif/movie/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  I agree some original research posts [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__pYj9UHfc) can be only be released as videos and not the source code because of its commercial value. But most of the gif/movie/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: Ramen generation). 

The problem here is If we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. In future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of Machine learning field. What's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone?.

heiyqq,MachineLearning,1592933475.0,"I know people on this sub have likely had their fill of fairness and bias related discussions the past few days, but I feel compelled to point out a letter (and associated petition) to the editors of Springer Nature asking them not to publish a paper purporting to identify likely criminals from images of faces.

&nbsp;

https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16

&nbsp;

Nevermind that this type of research direction has been demonstrated to be fatally flawed in the past. The fact that this work is being legitimized with a peer reviewed stamp of approval makes me wonder when the first ML phrenology paper will surface.

&nbsp;

I think the important takeaway is understanding the differing definitions of bias. The letter makes it clear that the authors claim to “predict if someone is a criminal based solely on a picture of their face,” with “80 percent accuracy and with no racial bias.” The problem being that by using the phrase “no racial bias” they are conflating the issue of algorithmic bias with the societal notion of bias. The letter spells out the societal aspect quite well:

> Let’s be clear: there is no way to develop a system that can predict or identify “criminality” that is not racially biased — because the category of “criminality” itself is racially biased.

&nbsp;

Maybe we have a terminology issue that we as an ML community need to address so we can better convey the distinction between algorithmic bias (which may or may not be desirable depending on the desired result) versus the societal notion of bias, which can be codified in the datasets we use.

&nbsp;

Anyway, despite the length of the letter, I think it’s an important read as it clearly elucidates a number of the issues that have been discussed around fairness in ML. I also urge people to sign the petition and email Springer Nature your concerns if you feel so inclined.

&nbsp;

EDIT: Looks like the petition worked pretty quickly. Springer Nature isn’t going to publish the paper, though I would still urge people to read the linked letter (and the excellent footnotes) and potentially still show solidarity by signing the petition.

r5thf9,datascience,1638295959.0,"Hey all, 

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I'm about to graduate with a masters of biomedical data science this may. After an internship with amazon this summer and around 40 applications/15 interviews over the course of the school year I got a job offer from a large tech company. 

The study guides from this subreddit have helped me the whole way through and I genuinely wanted to thank the community again. I started out with an undergraduate degree in biology/stats, and have self taught programming based on the advice given from this sub. I started reading it as a junior in my undergrad as I was trying trying transition from biology to analytics. While sometimes there can be discouraging posts, the advice some users give has really made an impact on me and given me insight into the career field that I was able to use when choosing my courses or finding skills to work on in my free time. 

I come from a very underprivileged background of poverty, paid my way though both my degrees alone, and have struggled with imposter syndrome as a woman in CS. I just want others to know that you don't have to be the best, get straight As or land the first interview to be worthy of a good job. I have really struggled this year and felt terrible about 2 out of my 5 interview rounds but still somehow found myself with a substantial offer letter. 

So this is where I am now. I'm excited, don't even feel like it's real yet, but I'm also anxious for the future and want to prove myself even more. 

I'm not sure if it would be of any help, but I wanted to try and give back to the community. If anyone wants to know my interview experience or my experience with applications I'd be happy to talk about it with them in the comments or DMs. I'll try to get back to as many people as possible if there is interest. 

Thank you all for the time you put into your posts and for those who have tried to mentor new people to DS.

uryrot,datascience,1652828294.0,"I joined this mid-sized financial industry company (\~500 employees) some time ago as a Dev Manager. One thing lead to another and now I'm a Data Science Manager. 

I am not an educated Data Scientist. No PhD or masters, just a CS degree + 15 years of software development experience, mostly with Python and Java. I always liked analytics and data, and over the years I did a lot of *data sciency* work (e.g: pretty reports with insights, predictions, dashboards, etc...) that management and different stakeholders appreciated a lot. My biggest project, although personal, was a website that would automatically collect covid related data and make predictions on how it will evolve. It was quite a big thing in my country and at one point I had more than 5M views daily. It was entirely a hobby project that went viral, but I learned a lot from it and this is what made me interested in actual data science.

About two years ago, before I joined the company, they started building a Data Science team. They hired a Fortune 500 Data Scientist with a lot of experience under his belt, but not so much management experience. With the help of a more experienced manager, with no relation to Data Science, he had the objective to put together the team and start delivery. In about 6 months the team was ready. It was entirely PhD level. One year later the manager left and so did the team. It's hard for me to say what really happened. Management says they haven't delivered what they were supposed to, while the team was saying the expectations were too high. Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle. As soon as the manager resigned, they asked me directly if I want to build and lead the new team. I was somehow ""famous"" because of the covid website. There was also a big raise involved which convinced me to bypass the *impostor syndrome*. Anyway, I am now leading a new team I put together. 

I had about 50 interviews over the next couple of months. Most of the people I hired were not data scientists per se, but they all knew Python quite well and were **very** detail oriented. Management was somehow surprised on why I'm not hiring PhD level, but they went along with it.

Personally, I hated the fact that most PhDs I've interviewed didn't want to do any data engineering, devops, testing or even reports. I'm not saying that they should be focused on these areas, but they should be able to sometimes do a little bit of them. Especially reports. In my books, as a data scientist you deliver insights extracted from data. Insights are delivered via reports that can take many forms. If you're not capable of reporting the insights you extracted in a way that stakeholders can understand, you are not a data scientist. Not a good one at least...

I started collecting the needs from business and see how they can be solved ""via data science"". They were all over the place. From fraud detection with NLU on e-mails and text recognition over invoices to chatbots and sales predictions. Took me some time to educate them on what low hanging fruits are and to understand what they want without them actually telling me what they want. I mean, most of the stuff they wanted were pure sci-fi level requirements, but in reality what they needed were simple regressions, classifiers and analytics. Some guy wanted to build a chatbot using neural gases, because he saw a cool video about it on youtube.

Less than a month later we went in production with a pretty dashboard that shows some sales metrics and makes predictions on future sales and customer churn. They were all blown away by it and congratulated us for doing it entirely ourselves without asking for any help, especially on the devops side of things. Very important to mention that I had the huge advantage of already understanding how the company works, where the data is and what it means, how the infrastructure is put together and how it can be leveraged. Without this knowledge it would have probably took A LOT longer.

Six months have passed and the team goes quite well. We're making deployments in production every two weeks and management is very happy with our work.

Company has this internship program where grads come in and spend two 3-month long rotations in different teams. After these two rotations some of them get hired as permanent employees. At the beginning of each rotation we have a so called marketplace where each team ""sells"" their work and what a grad can learn from joining the team. They can do front-end, back-end, data engineering, devops, qa, *data science*, etc... They can choose from anything on the software development spectrum. They specify their options in order and then HR decides on where each one goes.

This week was the 3rd time our team was part of the marketplace. And this was the 3rd time ALL grads choose as their first option the data science team. What they don't know is that all previous grads we had in the team decided Data Science is not for them. Their feedback was that there's too much of a hustle to understand the data and that they're not really doing any of the cool AI stuff they've seen on YouTube.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that data science is very seductive. It seduces management to dream for insights that will make them rich and successful, it seduces grads to think they will build J.A.R.V.I.S. and it seduces some data scientists to think it is ok not to do the ""dirty"" work.

At the end of the day, it's just me that got seduced into thinking that it is ok to share this on reddit after a couple of beers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uryrot/data_science_is_seductive/,Data Science is Seductive,Meta,878,107,0.97

m3in2j,datascience,1615559248.0,"I've seen a few posts about how to find volunteer opportunities, or get experience before you are able to land a full-time job.  One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.

iorbjg,datascience,1599561718.0,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers & textbooks, ML through whitepapers & textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process & rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms & design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly & understanding  new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble & prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data & modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy & Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.

Lastly, Data science is not all SQL. It depends on how close you are to the revenue generating side. If you’re making a quarterly report on demand, that isn’t data science. If you’re building growth models to accelerate users on your platform that tie to scale and revenue.

I realize that its difficult to stomach rejection, and I empathize with you as I'm submitting as well and will likely get a reject as well.

But please, please, please, please, as someone who has already spent 20-30 hours reviewing this week, and will likely be spending another 30-40 hours this week on the reviewing process. Please!

Stop submitting unfinished work to conferences.

At this point more than half of the papers I'm reviewing are clearly unfinished work. They have significant, unmistakable flaws to the point that no reasonable person can believe that this work could possibly appear in a peer reviewed, top tier conference. No reasonable person can put these submitted papers next to even the worst ICML paper from the last few years, and believe that yeah, they're of similar or higher quality.

Please take the time to get your work reviewed by your peers, or even your advisor prior to submission. If they can find \*any\* flaw in your work, I assure you, your reviewers are going to find so many flaws and give you a hurtful, and demoralizing review.

I realize that we're all in a huge hype bubble, and we all want to ride the hype train, but reviewing these unfinished works makes me feel so disrespected by the authors. They're clearly submitting for early feedback. It's not fair to the conference system and the peer review process to ask your reviewers to do \*unpaid\* research work for you and advise you on how to construct and present your work. It's not fair to treat your reviewers as free labor.

It takes me at a \*minimum\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours. That's 10+ hours of my life that these authors think is entitled to them to help them in their research so they can get published. It makes me feel so disrespected, and quite honestly, makes me want to give up on signing up as a reviewer if this is the quality of work I am expected to review.

Not only are these authors being selfish, but they're hurting the overall research community, conference quality, and the peer review process. More unfinished work being submitted, means reviewers have a higher workload. We don't get to spend as much time on each paper as we would like to, meaning \*good well written deserving papers\* either get overlooked, unfairly rejected, or get terrible feedback. This is simply unacceptable!

These authors, quite honestly, are acting like those people who hoard toilet paper during an epidemic. They act selfishly to the detriment of the community, putting themselves above both the research process, and other authors who submit good work.

Please, please, PLEASE don't do this. Submit finished, good work, that you think is ready for publication and peer review.

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

So far they've been interesting and I've engaged in some good discussions, but one thing that I've noticed is the sheer amount of people who ask something like ""I have no math or computer background, how do I get into data science?"" I'm not trying to be elitist, because I think the field has room for everyone, and we need more data literacy in general. I encourage them, but like, you wouldn't consider becoming an engineer without an engineering background, you wouldn't consider becoming a cell biologist without a biology background. I can understand someone working a job they're dissatisfied with wanting to change careers, and like I said, I encourage it, but I'm wondering where the idea of this being an easy thing to do is coming from, and a tad worried that some (but certainly not all) seem to have a disregard of the underlying math and CS.

I was a bit hesitant because I didn’t know what to expect and many people here made SQL monkeys look so bad. Most of my work involves writing queries and making dashboards, and right from the start people showed great appreciation for my work. Yes, I did mess up several times, but I was never scolded about it. Instead, I was nicely told how to deal with it. 

I have less than 2 years of experience out of college and I make just above 6 figures. I’m also expecting a 15-20% increase in the next year. I’m also doing a master's in data science at the same time to solidify my role in the industry and in case I decide I wanna switch to a more “data sciency” role. I have the opportunity to learn more about machine learning from different teams here and maybe eventually switch to one but I’m really happy with where I’m at at the moment, especially since it’s a very low-stress environment.

hkiyir,MachineLearning,1593782531.0,"Google has some serious cultural problems with proper credit assignment. They continue to rename methods discovered earlier DESPITE admitting the existence of this work.

See this new paper they released:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536)

Stop calling this method SWISH; its original name is SILU. The original Swish authors from Google even admitted to this mistake in the past ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r\_swish\_a\_selfgated\_activation\_function\_google/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/)). And the worst part is this new paper has the very same senior author as the previous Google paper.

And just a couple weeks ago, the same issue again with the SimCLR paper. See thread here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d\_on\_the\_public\_advertising\_of\_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d_on_the_public_advertising_of_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

They site only cite prior work with the same idea in the last paragraph of their supplementary and yet again rename the method to remove its association to the prior work. This is unfair. Unfair to the community and especially unfair to the lesser known researchers who do not have the advertising power of Geoff Hinton and Quoc Le on their papers.

SiLU/Swish is by Stefan Elfwing, Eiji Uchibe, Kenji Doya ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118)).

Original work of SimCLR is by Mang Ye, Xu Zhang, Pong C. Yuen, Shih-Fu Chang ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436))

Update:

Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel also proposed the SiLU non-linearity in 2016 in their work Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415))

Update 2:

""Smooth Adversarial Training"" by Cihang Xie is only an example of the renaming issue because of issues in the past by Google to properly assign credit. Cihang Xie's work is not the cause of this issue. Their paper does not claim to discover a new activation function. They are only using the SiLU activation function in some of their experiments under the name Swish. [Cihang Xie will provide an update of the activation function naming used in the paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r\_google\_has\_a\_credit\_assignment\_problem\_in/fwtttqo?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x) to reflect the correct naming. 

The cause of the issue is Google in the past decided to continue with renaming the activation as [Swish despite being made aware of the method already having the name SiLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941). Now it is stuck in our research community and stuck in our ML libraries (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41066).",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r_google_has_a_credit_assignment_problem_in/,[R] Google has a credit assignment problem in research,Research,825,127,0.96

gj475j,MachineLearning,1589393245.0,"Hello! I've been working on [this word does not exist](http://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com/). In it, I ""learned the dictionary"" and trained a GPT-2 language model over the Oxford English Dictionary. Sampling from it, you get realistic sounding words with fake definitions and example usage, e.g.:

>**pellum (noun)**  
>  
>the highest or most important point or position  
>  
>*""he never shied from the pellum or the right to preach""*

On the [website](http://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com/), I've also made it so you can prime the algorithm with a word, and force it to come up with an example, e.g.:

>  
>rejections of any given post or comment.  
>  
>*""a subredditdemos""*

Most of the project was spent throwing a number of rejection tricks to make good samples, e.g.,

* Rejecting samples that contain words that are in the a training set / blacklist to force generation completely novel words
* Rejecting samples without the use of the word in the example usage
* Running a part of speech tagger on the example usage to ensure they use the word in the correct POS

eyg2hv,MachineLearning,1580771911.0,"TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant. 

Spent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using ""deep learning"". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?



I've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning. 

Recently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was ""Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning/Deep Learning"". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear. 

To top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference.

We spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find). 
Cue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc. 

After all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work. 

During the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was ""so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?"". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered ""so its not a Neural net"", to himself, and walked away. 

We lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used ""deep learning"". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning. 

I know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used ""Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment""....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning.

We have a [PhD level or Advanced courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/51qhc8/phdlevel_courses/) thread in the sidebar but it's three year old now. There were two other 7-8 month old threads ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cae59l/d_advanced_courses_update/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cjnund/d_what_are_your_favorite_videos_lectures_on/)) but they don't have many quality responses either. 

So, can we have a new one here?

To reiterate - CS231n, CS229, ones from Udemy etc are not advanced. 

Advanced ML/DL/RL, attempts at building theory of DL, optimization theory, advanced applications etc are some examples of what I believe should belong here, much like the original sidebar post.

You can also suggest (new) categories for the courses you share. :)

He discusses the reality of ML deployments in four major parts of his work and how to cope with the boringness. Here is a quick summary and you can also check out the [original blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-is-boring-1d43473e353e) he wrote.

[**1. Designing**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=114.57635909155273)

\- Expected: Apply the latest & greatest algorithms on every project

\- Reality: Implement algorithms that will get the job done within the timeframe.

[**2. Coding**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=175.29553207390975)

\- Expected: Spend most time coding the ML component

\- Reality: Spend most time coding everything else (system, data pipeline, etc.)

[**3. Debugging**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=274.7941132145767)

\- Expected: Improve model performance (intellectually challenging & rewarding)

\- Reality: Fix traditional software issues to get a good enough result and move on

[**4. Firefighting**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=365.2176719809265)

\- Expected: not much

\- Reality: deal with unexpected internal/external problems all the time

[**Some coping mechanisms:**](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fb2e4a686dab96c840acd9e/?timecode=483.4506288521805)

Developing side projects, gamifying the debug process, talking to people in the industry, etc.

**Bottom line:**  You would need to accept that there are a lot more than just developing smart algorithms in a machine learning career. Try to cope with the frustration and boringness, and ""enjoy the small reward along the way and the final victory"".

Some Redditors asked me in private about the process. The interview process was competitive. One step of the process was a ML task, and the goal was to minimize the error metric. It was basically a single-player Kaggle competition. For most of the candidates, this was the hardest step of the recruitment process. Feature engineering and cross-validation were the two most important skills for the task. I did well due to my Kaggle knowledge, reading popular notebooks, and following ML practitioners on Kaggle/Github. For feature engineering and cross-validation, Kaggle is the best resource by far. Academic books and lectures are so outdated for these topics.

What I see in social media so often is underestimating Kaggle and other data science platforms. Of course in some domains, there are more important things than model accuracy. But in some domains, model accuracy is the ultimate goal. Financial domain goes into this cluster, you have to beat brilliant minds and domain experts, consistently. I've had academic research experience, beating benchmarks is similar to Kaggle competition approach. Of course, explainability, model simplicity, and other parameters are fundamental. I am not denying that. But I believe among Machine Learning professionals, Kaggle is still an underestimated platform, and this needs to be changed.

Edit: I think I was a little bit misunderstood. Kaggle is not just a competition platform. I've learned so many things from discussions, public notebooks. By saying Kaggle is important, I'm not suggesting grinding for the top %3 in the leaderboard. Reading winning solutions, discussions for possible data problems, EDA notebooks also really helps a junior data scientist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xgu9wg/kaggle_is_very_very_important/,"Kaggle is very, very important",Job Search,817,139,0.88

j1q5w2,datascience,1601345195.0,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

TLDR;
So in conclusion, data science isn't really a job, it's a job category. Find what interested you in that and that will greatly help you figure out what you need to learn and the path you should take.

But I did it anyway, and I didn't die! And they were still very nice to me.

I just wanted to share. If you've failed interviews for positions you thought were really cool, don't worry you are still so valuable.

I wanted to put this out there in case someone is feeling embarassed/sad they flunked an interview. And for interviewers I imagine they talk with a lot of people who fail tech-questions all the time, it's like a regular tuesday for them. You're not alone, and you're still really cool!

myiw7e,MachineLearning,1619388491.0,"# Background

I recently graduated with a master's degree and was fortunate/unfortunate to glimpse the whole ""Academic"" side of ML. I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ). 

I worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master’s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor’s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master’s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.  

Come to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins. 

# Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative

Let's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice. 

# Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML/AI is shady 

I am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.  

***The core problem lies in the fact that peer review is free. :*** There should be better solutions for this. We ended up creating Git and that changed so many lives. Academic Research needs something similar.

# Rant 3: My Idea is Novel Until I see Someone Else's Paper

The volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar. 

The side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something ""novel"" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel. 

I have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is ""Novel"". 

# Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth

Whatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements. 

All of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations/research-focus calibrate the ""hire-ability"" and ""completion of Ph.D. thesis"" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better. 

# Conclusion

A Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because ""we"" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.


P.S.
Never expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant. 

U shouldn’t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture.

I realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system.

We’re part of the team behind Meta AI’s latest AI breakthrough in machine translation with our No Language Left Behind (NLLB) project. It’s a translation system that can support over 200 languages, even if there isn't a lot of text available to learn from.   The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web meaning only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems – ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in.   Here are a few things about NLLB we’re excited for:

* Latest breakthrough: we created a single model that translates over 200 different languages with state-of-the-art results.
* Billions of translations: We’re applying the techniques from the research advancements from NLLB to support more than 25 billion translations served every day on Facebook News Feed, Instagram, and our other platforms.
* Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC): This large-scale conditional language model is one of the first AI models trained on Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer.
* Open sourcing: By open sourcing our model and publishing a slew of research tools, we hope that AI researchers whose languages are not supported well or at all on commercial translations services could use our model to create support for that language. Furthermore, we’ve open sourced datasets, such as NLLB-Seed and FLORES-200 evaluation benchmark, which doubles the existing language coverage over our previous benchmark.
* Wikimedia Foundation collaboration: We collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation to help improve translation systems on their Content Translations tool. Editors can now more efficiently translate and edit articles in 20  low-resource languages, including 10 that previously were not supported by any machine translation tools on the platform. 
* Books translation: we’re partnering with local publishers around the world to translate children’s stories.

n10o03,datascience,1619688353.0,"Context: I used to love working with technology. When I was younger I did computer science at school, worked at Apple at 17 & had work experience at Toshiba Research Europe. Everything was going great until I got my GCSE grades back and realised my coursework was terrible. It wasn’t my fault but rather the teacher had taught us the complete wrong thing to do and only 1 person managed to pass. He was fired but when it came to A Levels I didn’t end up picking computer science. As much as I wanted to, I was anxiety riddled as a teenager and I didn’t believe in myself to do it. I ended up going to university, dropping out because of severe depression & going into bookkeeping. Then lockdown happened. I had so much free time that I ended up doing programming for fun & I got Reddit to try and find fixes to syntax errors when I’m programming but Reddit recommended me this subreddit & data is beautiful and I would check it everyday just because I found it interesting & it was the perfect blend between number crunching and technology - leading me to learn Python & get better with excel.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I manage to get an interview with an amazing employer to work as a Junior Data Analyst. I was really worried because I didn’t know who or what the competition was but I did my best & I mentioned that I followed these pages on Reddit.

lqozmp,datascience,1614104086.0,"Today, I had a 45mins technical interview with a media based company and I thought I'd share the questions with you all since so many people on this subreddit are looking for jobs. I hope it helps someone! :)

**Background:**

I currently work as a DS and I have 1.5 years of work ex in the data and analytics field. I was initially hired as a DA so my interview was based on SQL which was quite easy (i'm a CS undergrad). I later got promoted to a DS position so I hadn't faced any serious technical DS interviews until today.

**Technical Questions asked:**

1. How would you go about predicting hotel prices for a company like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I previously worked at a similar company as a business analyst and hence the question. I was able to answer this based on the work I had done there.
2. Let's say you have a categorical column with 500 categories. How would you tackle this? - I answered that we can use Catboost as it uses the catboost target encoder which would help convert the categorical values into numerical values rather than going for one hot encoding. He then mentioned that he wants to use linear regression so I said that we can use target encoding methods like James Stein encoder or Catboost encoder(preferred as it tackles target leakage). Was my answer right or is there some other way because he didn't seem 100% convinced with it?
3. How would you check the weight of each feature in a decision tree? - I said that we can look at the feature importance of each feature. He then asked if a feature importance of 100 means the feature's influence on the target is 100? To which I replied that you can see the SHAP values to understand the influence of a feature on the target but honestly I haven't researched enough on it to comment further.
4. Can I use K Means with categorical data? - You can use one hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical but using K Means with Euclidian distance on binary columns does not make sense so I would use K Modes rather than K Means for categorical data
5. How do I choose the number of clusters for K Means? - use elbow method or silhouette score and I explained both the methods
6. Let's say I use silhouette analysis on a customer segmentation exercise and get K=30 as optimal number of clusters. I can't show 30 clusters to the business so what do I do now? - I said that generally for customer segmentation we would need business input as well so what is a practical number of segments according to the business? He replied 5-10 so I said that well out of the 5-10 clusters whichever has the highest silhouette score should be chosen. But I don't know if this is the right answer?
7. Difference b/w K Means and K modes? - I just said that for categorical data we use K Modes because finding the mode of a particular category is more accurate and makes more sense rather than converting the category to binary values and using a distance algo like K Means.
8. How would you perform customer segmentation on OTT platforms? - I panicked on this one honestly and said age, gender, nationality and probably genre of shows, do they watch shows completely, how long have they been a member on the OTT platform (Yes ik some of these don't make sense but like i said i PANCIKED)
9. Do you think the above mentioned factors are a good representative of the customer lifetime value? - Uhh no idea what customer life time value means so I just winged this one
10. Can you have more than one independent variable in ARIMA? - I answered yes cause I do vaguely remember coming across this but I am not 100% sure.
11. What is the difference b/w ARIMA and ARIMAX? - ARIMAX is ARIMA but also has exogenous variables which help identify surges like holidays.
12. Would you use ARIMA or Prophet for time series? - I read an article that says a properly tuned SARIMA would outperform Prophet so i answered the same
13. How would you tune ARIMA? - by finding the best parameter values for p,d,q
14. What are p,d,q in ARIMA? - (I forgot what they represent but I tried to answer from whatever I could recall ) p=no. of previous lags to consider, q= i forgot, d = difference(?)
15. What exactly is ""d""? - I said that it represents the seasonality pattern but I now realize that seasonality is in SARIMA and not ARIMA. (ugh)
16. Can you pass non - stationary data to ARIMA? - No, because the assumption of TS is that data is stationary with constant mean and variance as it will assume the same patterns for future values as well
17. How do we check if data is stationary? - By plotting it first but more accurate way is to use Dickey Fuller test to confirm it
18. How do I choose which 10 new hotels to onboard on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I said that we can look at the number of bookings, location, accessibility( metro, bus), is it near a tourist spot, reviews, stars.
19. What if my model has recommended that all the 10 new hotels that we should onboard should be from the same area X? How do I add a constraint to fix this? - I don't even know what topic this question is from but I said maybe you can modify the cost function by adding a variable which will penalize the cost function based on the number of hotels it suggests that belong to the same area or maybe we can add constraints to the cost function
20. If I add constraints to the cost function then it becomes a non linear optimization problem so how would you use linear programming to solve it? - I had no idea lol
21. What is the difference b/w segmentation and clustering? - I answered that segmentation is a use case of clustering but apparently the interviewer said that clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm while segmentation is a supervised learning algorithm.
22. Have you created a data pipeline before? - Nope

&#x200B;

vzmcc2,datascience,1657884407.0,"Hey everyone,

We're entering difficult economic times, so I thought I could share some of the tactics I've used to get more job opportunities my way by making my LinkedIn (LI) profile stand out.

I'm not an influencer on LI nor I have insider information about its talent search algorithm. This information comes from reading papers about LI's search algorithms, researching LI Recruiter, and a lot trial and error experimenting with my own profile.

Let me begin by setting the stage.

To find candidates, recruiters use a tool called LI Recruiter. It allows them to enter relevant search terms such as ""Data Scientist"" and define filters such as ""has worked at Google"" to look for candidates.

After a query is defined, LI Recruiter uses a ""talent search algorithm"" that works in two stages:

1. It searches the network and defines a set of a few thousand candidates who meet the recruiter's search criteria.
2. Then the candidates are ranked based on how well they fit the search term and how likely they are to respond.

That's it. If your goal is to get more job opportunities your way, then you need to figure out how to improve your chances of appearing in 1 and ranking higher in 2.

Luckily, LI has published research about its talent search algorithm. It's not hard to get an idea of what will help you stand out from the  competition. Based on my research and experience, here are some things that should help your profile stand-out:

1. **Use relevant keywords in your profile.** You won't appear in the results if you don't include terms in your profile that recruiters use when they search for candidates. Review the keywords used in Job descriptions of the positions you're interested in, and make sure you have those in your profile.
2. **Reply to recruiters.** People often don't reply to recruiters when they're not interested in the job  opportunity. But the algorithm prioritizes those who are likely to  respond over those who are not. Respond to recruiters, even if it's just  to say no!
3. **Grow your network.** The lightweight version of LI  Recruiter only lets recruiters reach out to candidates up to their  3rd-degree network. Having few connections decreases your chances of  getting contacted.
4. **Gain influence.** You rank higher if you create  engaging content, have many visitors to your profile, or receive  endorsements and recommendations. As a general rule, try to write useful  content periodically and ask for recommendations from relevant  connections.
5. **Make relevant connections.** Wanna work at X? Make meaningful connections from X and interact with the brand. When recruiters from X are looking for candidates, you will rank higher.
6. **Use a photo.** This is based on my personal experience. A photo, especially a ""good"" one, increases the likelihood that recruiters will contact you.

If you have any questions, shoot me a message. And just for reference, here's [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo/).

vceaxx,datascience,1655242717.0,"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right. Just to demonstrate foundational knowledge that they can build on in the role. The point is most the candidates with DS masters were not competitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vceaxx/so_many_bad_masters/,So many bad masters,Education,784,448,0.89

I’ve just finished building a little side project of mine - [https://gpu.land/](https://gpu.land/).

**What is it?** Cheap GPU instances in the cloud.

**Why is it awesome?**

* It’s dirt-cheap. You get a Tesla V100 for $0.99/hr, which is 1/3 the cost of AWS/GCP/Azure/\[insert big cloud name\].
* It’s dead simple. It takes 2mins from registration to a launched instance. Instances come pre-installed with everything you need for Deep Learning, including a 1-click Jupyter server.
* It sports a retro, MS-DOS-like look. Because why not:)

I’m a self-taught ML engineer. I built this because when I was starting my ML journey I was totally lost and frustrated by AWS. Hope this saves some of you some nerve cells (and some pennies)!

The most common question I get is - how is this so cheap? The answer is because AWS/GCP are charging you a huge markup and I’m not. In fact I’m charging just enough to break even, and built this project really to give back to community (and to learn some of the tech in the process).

beoxx8,MachineLearning,1555611935.0,"TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more ""fashionable"" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update (Jump to below the line for the original story): 

Several people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant. 

My response: 
Of course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other. 
Moreover, it is also the case that ML/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line.

My point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML/DS community, namely: 
* The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams 
* The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge). 
* Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)* 

Company A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one. Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge. 

They have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly. In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers. 

Interestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts. It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays. A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team ""Team X"". 

Sometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team ""Y"" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team ""Y"" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience. 

As is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers ""data driven"" and ""AI powered"" in their upcoming shareholder meetings. In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience  consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.  But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems. 

A couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word ""data science"", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem. They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board. 

As they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created. 

Team X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders. But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was ""We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion."", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics. 

Team X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard. 

Meanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production. 

Unbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal.

An outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y. 

Team Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production. 

Ironically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%. 

At best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off.

At worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force. Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada. 

One might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI. 

But I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd. 

We haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/beoxx8/discussion_when_ml_and_data_science_are_the_death/,[Discussion] When ML and Data Science are the death of a good company: A cautionary tale.,Discussion,766,198,0.96

c4ylga,MachineLearning,1561420756.0,"*Recently, I saw a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8) by [Rajiv Shah](https://twitter.com/rajcs4), Chicago-based data-scientist, regarding an article published in Nature last year called [Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y), written by scientists at Harvard in collaboration with Google. Below is the article:*

**Stand Up for Best Practices:
Misuse of Deep Learning in Nature’s Earthquake Aftershock Paper**

**The Dangers of Machine Learning Hype**

Practitioners of AI, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data science have grown enormously over the last few years. What was once a niche field defined by its blend of knowledge is becoming a rapidly growing profession. As the excitement around AI continues to grow, the new wave of ML augmentation, automation, and GUI tools will lead to even more growth in the number of people trying to build predictive models.

But here’s the rub: While it becomes easier to use the tools of predictive modeling, predictive modeling knowledge is not yet a widespread commodity. Errors can be counterintuitive and subtle, and they can easily lead you to the wrong conclusions if you’re not careful.

I’m a data scientist who works with dozens of expert data science teams for a living. In my day job, I see these teams striving to build high-quality models. The best teams work together to review their models to detect problems. There are many hard-to-detect-ways that lead to problematic models (say, by allowing target leakage into their training data).

Identifying issues is not fun. This requires admitting that exciting results are “too good to be true” or that their methods were not the right approach. In other words, *it’s less about the sexy data science hype that gets headlines and more about a rigorous scientific discipline.*

**Bad Methods Create Bad Results**

Almost a year ago, I read an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) in Nature that claimed unprecedented accuracy in predicting earthquake aftershocks by using deep learning. Reading the article, my internal radar became deeply suspicious of their results. *Their methods simply didn’t carry many of the hallmarks of careful predicting modeling.*

I started to dig deeper. In the meantime, this article blew up and became [widely recognized](https://blog.google/technology/ai/forecasting-earthquake-aftershock-locations-ai-assisted-science/)! It was even included in the [release notes](https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8) for Tensorflow as an example of what deep learning could do. However, in my digging, I found major flaws in the paper. Namely, data leakage which leads to unrealistic accuracy scores and a lack of attention to model selection (you don’t build a 6 layer neural network when a simpler model provides the same level of accuracy).

To my earlier point: these are subtle, but *incredibly basic* predictive modeling errors that can invalidate the entire results of an experiment. Data scientists are trained to recognize and avoid these issues in their work. I assumed that this was simply overlooked by the author, so I contacted her and let her know so that she could improve her analysis. Although we had previously communicated, she did not respond to my email over concerns with the paper.

**Falling On Deaf Ears**

So, what was I to do? My coworkers told me to just [tweet](https://twitter.com/rajcs4/status/1143236424738775046) [it](https://twitter.com/DataScienceLA/status/1143245342785228800) and let it go, but I wanted to stand up for good modeling practices. I thought reason and best practices would prevail, so I started a 6-month process of writing up my results and shared them with Nature.
Upon sharing my results, I received a note from Nature in January 2019 that despite serious concerns about data leakage and model selection that invalidate their experiment, they saw no need to correct the errors, because “**Devries et al. are concerned primarily with using machine learning as [a] tool to extract insight into the natural world, and not with details of the algorithm design**.” The authors provided a much [harsher](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues/blob/master/correspondence/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf) response.

You can read the entire exchange on my [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).

It’s not enough to say that I was disappointed. This was a major paper (it’s **Nature**!) that bought into AI hype and published a paper despite it using flawed methods.

Then, just this week, I ran [across](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) [articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01983) by Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo on shortcomings that they found in the aftershocks article. Here are two more data scientists with expertise in earthquake analysis who also noticed flaws in the paper. I also have placed my analysis and reproducible code on [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).

**Standing Up For Predictive Modeling Methods**

I want to make it clear: my goal is not to villainize the authors of the aftershocks paper. I don’t believe that they were malicious, and I think that they would argue their goal was to just show how machine learning could be applied to aftershocks. Devries is an accomplished earthquake scientist who wanted to use the latest methods for her field of study and found exciting results from it.

But here’s the problem: their insights and results were based on fundamentally flawed methods. It’s not enough to say, “This isn’t a machine learning paper, it’s an earthquake paper.” If you use predictive modeling, then the quality of your results are determined by the quality of your modeling. Your work becomes data science work, and you are on the hook for your scientific rigor.

There is a huge appetite for papers that use the latest technologies and approaches. It becomes very difficult to push back on these papers.

But if we allow papers or projects with fundamental issues to advance, it hurts all of us. It undermines the field of predictive modeling.

Please push back on bad data science. Report bad findings to papers. And if they don’t take action, go to twitter, post about it, share your results and make noise. This type of collective action worked to raise awareness of p-values and combat the epidemic of p-hacking. We need good machine learning practices if we want our field to continue to grow and maintain credibility.

I'm just so sick of the hype in this field, I want to feel like I'm doing engineering work/proper science but I'm constantly met with buzz words and ""business-y"" type language. I was browsing and I saw the announcement for the Tensorflow World conference happening now, and I went on the website and was again met with ""Be part of the ML revolution."" in big bold letters. Like okay, I understand that businesses need to get investors, but for the past 2 years of being in this field I'm really starting to feel like I'm in marketing and not engineering. I'm not saying the products don't deliver or that there's miss-advertising, but there's just too much involvement of ""business type"" folks more so in this field compared to any other field of engineering and science... and I really hate this. It makes me wonder why is this the case? How come there's no towardschemicalengineering.com type of website? Is it because its really easy for anyone to enter this field and gain a superficial understanding of things? 

The issue I have with this is that I feel a constant pressure to frame whatever I'm doing with marketing lingo otherwise you immediately lose people's interest if you don't play along with the hype.

mimpre,datascience,1617377518.0,"Few months ago, I wrote in this thread (with an older account) about how I think some Data Scientists are getting underpaid and negotiation is an important skill during interviews as much as ML frameworks. It was meant to be a message to uplift all of us into better career development.

But when I wrote that my first job as a Data Scientist was making $150k a year and that we can easily make $200k with upgraded skills, experience and right negotiation, people here laughed at me -- said that I was trolling and that kind of salary was insane. I told them this is the average in the Bay Area, but they said that even seniors don't make this kind of salary.

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF (not well known, but a stable company). I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still.

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation.

1. Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy.
2. If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. This requires a refined skill in both communication and technical chops
3. Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff. Too many tech folks don't like to do this and think that they can keep their heads down and work hard, and their accomplishments will be naturally rewarded by some supernatural force. That's rarely the case. Data and Software folks are not immune to necessities of nuanced and skillful communication.

BTW, I don't have FANG-level experience.

ldvl72,datascience,1612609214.0,"So I'd expected the hype to die off by now, but if anything it's getting worse. Are there any groups out there actively pushing back against the ridiculous hype?

I've worked as a data scientist for 5+ years now, and have recently been looking for a new position. I'm honestly shocked at how some of the interviewers seem to view a data science job as little more than an extended Kaggle competition.

A few days ago, during an interview, I was told ""We want to build a neural network"" - I've started really pushing back in interviews. My response was along the lines: you don't need a neural network, Jesus you don't have any infrastructure and your data is beyond shite (all said politely in a non-condescending way, just paraphrasing here!).

I went on to talk about the value they CAN get out of ML and how we could build up to NN. I laid out a road map: Let's identify what problems your business is trying to solve (hint might not even need ML), eventually scope and translate those business problems into ML projects, start identifying ways in which we can improve your data quality, start building up some infrastructure, and for the love of god start automating processes because clearly I will not be processing all your data by hand. Update: Some people seem to think I did this in a rude way: guys I was professional at all times. I'm paraphrasing with a little dramatic flair - don't take it verbatim.

To my surprise, people gloss over at this point. They really were not interested in hearing about how one would go about project managing large data science problems. Or hearing about my experience in DS project management. They just wanted to hear buss words and know whether I knew particular syntax. They were even more baffled when I told them I have to look up half the syntax, because I automate most of the low-level stuff - as I'm sure most of us do. There seems to be such a disconnect here. It just baffles me. Employers seem to have quite a warped view of day-to-day life as a data scientist.

73n9pm,MachineLearning,1506881780.0,"I have a confession to make.

I was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.

I joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I’m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What’s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don’t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.

For example, I’ve never heard of the term “Lipschitz” or “Wasserstein distance” before, so I’m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf). I don’t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The “Normalizing Flow” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) … each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don’t even know where to start wrapping my head around. 

I’ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn’t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It’s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but … 

* reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can’t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn’t be happy.
* but if I don’t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle. 
* the “utility density” of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don’t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again. 
* in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with “Langevin flow”. The oracle would return a list of pointers, “given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop’s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of …”. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose. 

I’m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. 
Is it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration? 

EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation!

m3boyo,MachineLearning,1615530415.0,"I have seen so many posts on social media about how great pytorch is and, in one latest tweet, 'boomers' use tensorflow ... It doesn't make sense to me and I see it as being incredibly powerful and widely used in research and industry. Should I be jumping ship? What is the actual difference and why is one favoured over the other? I have only used tensorflow and although I have been using it for a number of years now, still am learning. Should I be switching? Learning both? I'm not sure this post will answer my question but I would like to hear your honest opinion why you use one over the other or when you choose to use one instead of the other.

EDIT: thank you all for your responses. I honestly did not expect to get this much information and I will definitely be taking a harder look at Pytorch and maybe trying it in my next project. For those of you in industry, do you see tensorflow used more or Pytorch in a production type implementation? My work uses tensorflow and I have heard it is used more outside of academia - mixed maybe at this point?

EDIT2: I read through all the comments and here are my summaries and useful information to anyone new seeing this post or having the same question: 

TL;DR: People were so frustrated with TF 1.x that they switched to PT and never came back.

* Python is 30 years old FYI 
* Apparently JAX is actually where the cool kids are … this is feeling like highschool again, always the wrong crowd. 
* Could use pytorch to develop then convert with ONNX to tensorflow for deployment 
* When we say TF we should really say tf.keras. I would not wish TF 1.x on my worst enemy. 
* Can use PT in Colab. PT is also definitely popular on Kaggle
* There seems to be some indie kid rage where big brother google is not loved so TF is not loved. 
* TF 2.x with tf.keras and PT seem to now do similar things. However see below for some details. Neither seems perfect but I am now definitely looking at PT. Just looking at the installation and docs is a winner. As a still TF advocate (for the time being) I encourage you to check out TF 2.x - a lot of comments are related to TF 1.x Sessions etc.

Reasons for: 

* PT can feel laborious. With tf.keras it seems to be simpler and quicker, however also then lack of control. 
* Seems to still win the production argument 
* TF is now TF.Keras. Eager execution etc. has made it more align with PT 
* TF now has numpy implementation right in there. As well as gradient tape in for loop fashion making it actually really easy to manipulate tensors.
* PT requires a custom training loop from the get go. Maybe TF 2.x easier then for beginners now and can be faster to get a quick and dirty implementation / transfer learning. 
* PT requires to specify the hardware too (?) You need to tell it which gpu to use? This was not mentioned but that is one feeling I had. 
* Tf.keras maybe more involved in industry because of short implementation time 
* Monitoring systems? Not really mentioned but I don't know what is out there for PT. eg TF dashboard, projector
* PT needs precise handling of input output layer sizes. You have to know math.
* How is PT on edge devices - is there tfLite equivalent? PT Mobile it seems

Reason for Pytorch or against TF:

* Pythonic
* Actually opensource
* Steep learning curve for TF 1.x. Many people seem to have switched and never looked back on TF 2.x. Makes sense since everything is the same for PT since beginning
* Easier implementation (it just works is a common comment)
* Backward compatibility and framework changes in TF. RIP your 1.x code. Although I have heard there is a tool to auto convert to TF 2.x - never tried it though. I'm sure it fails unless your code is perfect. Pytorch is stable through and through.
* Installation. 3000 series GPUs. I already have experience with this. I hate having to install TF on any new system. Looks like PT is easier and more compatible.
* Academia is on PT kick. New students learning it as the first. Industry doesn't seem to care much as long as it works and any software devs can use it.
* TF has an issue of many features / frameworks trying to be forced together, creating incompatibility issues. Too many ways to do one thing, not all of which will actually do what you need down the road. 
* Easier documentation - potentially. 
* The separation between what is in tf and tf.keras
* Possible deprecation for Jax, although with all the hype I honestly see Jax maybe just becoming TF 3.x
* Debug your model by accessing intermediate representations (Is this what MLIR in TF is now?)
* Slow TF start-up
* PyTorch has added support for ROCm 4.0 which is still in beta. You can now use AMD GPUs! WOW - that would be great, although I like the nvidia monopoly for my stocks!
* Although tf.keras is now simple and quick, it may be oversimplified. PT seems to be a nice middle for any experimentation. 

Funny / excellent comments: 

* ""I'd rather be punched in the face than having to use TensorFlow ever again."" 
* "" PyTorch == old-style Lego kits where they gave pretty generic blocks that you could combine to create whatever you want. TensorFlow == new-style Lego kits with a bunch of custom curved smooth blocks, that you can combine to create the exact picture on the box; but is awkward to build anything else. 
* On the possibility of dropping TF for Jax. ""So true, Google loves killing things: hangouts, Google plus, my job application.."" 
* ""I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. - Andrej Karpathy (2017)"" 
* ""I feel like there is 'I gave up on TF and never looked back feel here'""
* ""I hated the clusterfuck of intertwined APIs of TF2."" 
* ""…Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success."" 
* ""Keras is the gateway drug of DL!"" 
* ""like anything Google related they seemed to put a lot of effort into making the docs extremely unreadable and incomplete"" 
* ""more practical imo, pytorch is - the yoda bot"" 
* ""Pytorch easy, tensorflow hard, me lazy, me dumb. Me like pytorch.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m3boyo/d_why_is_tensorflow_so_hated_on_and_pytorch_is/,[D] Why is tensorflow so hated on and pytorch is the cool kids framework?,Discussion,741,258,0.97

y7708w,MachineLearning,1666099468.0,"Hi all, Just want to share my recent experience with you.

I'm an ML engineer have 4 years of experience mostly with NLP. Recently I needed a remote job so I applied to company X which claims they hire the top 3% (No one knows how they got this number).

I applied two times, the first time passed the coding test and failed in the technical interview cause I wasn't able to solve 2 questions within 30min (solved the first one and the second almost got it before the time is up).

Second Trial: I acknowledged my weaknesses and grinded Leetcode for a while (since this is what only matters these days to get a job), and applied again, this time I moved to the Technical Interview phase directly, again chatted a bit (doesn't matter at all what you will say about our experience) and he gave me a dataset and asked to reach 96% accuracy within 30 min :D :D, I only allowed to navigate the docs but not StackOverflow or google search, I thought this should be about showing my abilities to understand the problem, the given data and process it as much as I can and get a good result fastly.

so I did that iteratively and reached 90% ACC, some extra features had Nans, couldn't remember how to do it with Numby without searching (cause I already stacked multiple features together in an array), and the time is up, I told him what I would have done If I had more time.

The next day he sent me a rejection email, after asking for an explanation he told me "" **Successful candidates can do more progress within the time given, as have experience with pandas as they know (or they can easily find out) the pandas functions that allow them to do things quickly (for example, encoding categorical values, can be done in one line, and handling missing values can also be done in one line** "" (I did it as a separate process cause I'm used to having a separate processing function while deploying).

Why the fuck my experience is measured by how quickly I can remember and use Pandas functions without searching them? I mainly did NLP work for 3 years, I only used Pandas and Jupyter as a way of analyzing the data and navigating it before doing the actual work, why do I need to remember that? so not being able to one-line code (which is shitty BTW if you actually building a project you would get rid of pandas as much as you can) doesn't mean I'm good enough to be top 3% :D.

I assume at this point top1% don't need to code right? they just mentally telepath with the tools and the job is done by itself.

If after all these years of working and building projects from scratch literally(doing all the SWE and ML jobs alone) doesn't matter cause I can't do one-line Jupyter pandas code, then I'm doomed.

and Why the fuk everything is about speed these days? Is it a problem with me and I'm really not good enough or what ??",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/y7708w/d_how_frustrating_are_the_ml_interviews_these/,[D] How frustrating are the ML interviews these days!!!

jtbr8c,MachineLearning,1605246874.0,"I currently work on ML research and am feeling completely demotivated. I want to hear how y'all manage to stay focused and productive. At a high level, here are the main reasons why I find it hard to justify working 8+ hours a day on ML:

1. **The world is burning** (Covid, climate change, social unrest), and I'm constantly wondering what the opportunity cost is for not doing something more immediately impactful and meaningful. I try to be more humble and accept that the world doesn't need me to ""save"" it. But it also feels wrong to just hunker down and tinker with hyperparameters all day.
2. In the deep learning era, the day-to-day ML work feels like **shooting in the dark**. Honestly every time I try to do something principled and grounded in theory, reality slaps me in the face. It just doesn't work. What does work is anticlimactic: training bigger & longer, or arbitrarily tweaking BERT for whatever niche.
3. **The field is so crowded**. The arxiv firehose is overwhelming and (forgive my cynicism) so full of noise. So much gets published everyday, yet so little. There's this crazy race to publish anything, regardless how meaningless that extra layer you added to BERT is. And while I really try to keep my integrity and not write a paper about how I swept the s\*\*\* out of those hyperparameters and increased the average GLUE score by a whooping 0.2, realistically I still need to keep up with this crazy pace if I don't want to get fired.

I feel trapped because I can't find pleasure neither in the process (which has become synonymous with throwing stuff at BERT and seeing what happens), nor the outcome (wasting huge amounts of compute power in a world that is burning, occasionally discovering mildly uninteresting things). At the end of the day, I'm depleted of energy and so can't rely on other areas of my life to fill in the void.

k2pd9n,MachineLearning,1606576848.0,"I have been hearing some negativity about PhDs recently, much of it justified I am sure. However, as someone who has largely enjoyed their PhD in reinforcement learning, I thought I might explain some of the great things that can come from a PhD and give my advice on things to consider. My advice is not scientific and I am sure many others have written better advice you should also read\*. 

That being said, here is a list of things which can make doing a PhD really satisfying:

1. A productive relationship with your advisor/supervisor. If you are lucky, you will find a supervisor who is a world expert and who responds promptly to your questions, takes interest in your ideas and suggests helpful improvements.
2. The opportunity to learn about interesting topics without expectation of concrete output.
3. Day to day work which matches the skill set you want to develop
4. The autonomy to build a project based on your own ideas
5. The expertise of the lab and your ability to collaborate, receive feedback and socialise with them
6. Getting a chance to intern with industry
7. Publishing your work at top tier conferences and journals

If you can get all of these things out of your PhD it can be a really fun and worthwhile experience and, with a bit of luck, will set you up for great career opportunities afterwards. However, working things out before starting can be hard. So lets say you've narrowed it down to a few advisors, how do you evaluate points 1-7? Here are some tips:

&#x200B;

1. Read carefully your potential advisor’s best publications and recent impactful work. Check if they have successfully supervised students in the past. Get in contact with current or past students to hear how they work with their supervisor currently. If you can, do a rotation project as part of a PhD program or Masters degree.
2. Find out if people in the lab have a lot of pressure to publish. If they do, it may make it difficult to learn about other areas. Is your lab/University a hub for creative ideas from a variety of perspectives with opportunities to attend interesting lectures and interact with talented people?
3. You will be an expert in the area(s) in which you do your PhD. Think about the skill set that would give you and your ability to sell that after the PhD. Equally, think about the process of acquiring those skills, and whether you would enjoy that process.
4. Does your advisor already have a narrow project laid out for you or is it a broader picture (I would recommend the latter, although it does come with more risk). Does your advisor publish across a narrow range of topics or does he or she publish work in multiple related areas? Is that work high quality or low quality?
5. Meet current lab members and try to get a sense of their interests, expertise and willingness to collaborate. If they have recent publications read them and ask them about it.
6. An internship during your PhD is great both for learning and building a career. Machine learning is unusual in its ability to provide these opportunities so take them if you can!
7. Do people in your lab regularly publish in top tier conferences and journals? Is their work widely cited, or more concretely, has it directly impacted research in the field?

Finally, bear in mind that in reality it is very unlikely you have an opportunity which satisfies all these criteria, so be reasonable in your expectations, balance them against non-PhD opportunities and having evaluated all the evidence carefully, follow your gut. Good luck!

Oh, and one more thing:

The sunk cost fallacy is real. When thinking about your existing projects and future projects, don’t be afraid to change tack if you worked hard on an idea and it just isn’t panning out. Similarly, don’t be afraid to change supervisor and or people you collaborate with if you honestly gave it your best shot and things are not working out. Be aware of when you are spinning your wheels and not making progress and do everything you can (within reason of course) to get out of it. If things get really bad, don’t be afraid to drop out. A PhD should be about excitement and opportunity and not fear of failure. Save that for the rest of your life!

I have done a quick literature review at that time  (although I admit, it might not have been thorough enough) and I found  that no one really tried to use those shape priors before, especially  for the task that i wanted to use them on (these descriptors would fit  the specific task especially well). I worked hard on the implementation,  designing the network architecture, writing the article and  understanding all the necessary mathematical proofs/theorems related to  this task. I just submitted the article a few weeks ago (no word from it yet), and today, I  found an article on arxiv (no citations) that has been published this  spring and basically uses the same idea for the same task as I did. The  network architecture is different than mine and the performance  evaluation is different, but the main selling point of my article, the  usage of these shape priors has already been published. I am a bit  devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st  author paper and I really put a lot of effort and thought into this,  only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before.  Obviously I need to do a much more thorough literature review next time  so that this doesn't happen again, but besides that, I don't know what  else I could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my  motivation.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my overall feeling is that you are not reaping the rewards your masters/bootcamp/online course promised. You are not turning down people left and right asking for your services. And thus, you feel like the field is not what you wanted.

A bit of my background I started doing ""data science"" back in 2005, I have a Masters and a PhD on applied Machine Learning. I've done consulting in AI for NTT Japan (largest IT company in the country), done 2 postdocs in top 20 Universities, both of them on applied AI to Science. Consulting to the largest companies in LatAm, and currently on charge of 10+ ML/DataScience experts as ML Director as one of the Largest Banks in LatAm by assets.

* 1st Advice. If you are in it for the money, better invest wisely.

**If you have no experience**. Don't spend 400 usd in 400 little Udemy classes, or a Datacamp subscription, etc. Spend big and go to a big name school to do a Masters, there are plenty of funding options. Believe me, even if you learn the same thing, the fact that your certification/course says MIT instead of DataCamp is my only pointer if you don't have field experience at all. I say it again, this is **IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.**

* 2nd Advice. Get all the experience you can, even if it's pro bono!

There is nothing like working with real datasets, I couldn't care less if you did all the tutorials on tensorflow or Sklearn using MNIST or Fashion MNIST, guess what, so did the other 40 applicants. But if you were privy to any datasets that few people can access, then I can see some value if your business understanding and capability of deploying ML techniques with data that no one else has seen before.

Sound hard? no, is extremely easy, the fact that there is a shortage of talent is no illusion. Go to a local University and look for researchers that might need to use ML in something, and offer to do that analysis, or only cleaning the data for free. That gives you both experience and opens doors for future employment.

The most interesting datasets I've seen have been in projects that I did for free or very little money.

* 3rd Advice. Learn the business and build yourself a niche.

Again, there is a need for DS and ML practitioners, that is very real, I have 3 open positions right now. But guess what? I won't hire anyone with no Finance or related experience. I need people capable of understanding business terms, and are capable of reading a Cash Flow and an Income Statement. Few applicants really know how to do it or have any interest in how to do it.

I have friend in the oil industry and is the same story all over again, people just want access to a dataset with no interest in learning about oil or extracting processes.

The methods – roughly sorted from largest to smallest expected speed-up – are:

1. Consider using a different learning rate schedule.
2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader.
3. Max out the batch size.
4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).
5. Consider using a different optimizer.
6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking.
7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs.
8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing.
9. Use gradient accumulation.
10. Use DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training.
11. Set gradients to None rather than 0.
12. Use .as\_tensor rather than .tensor()
13. Turn off debugging APIs if not needed.
14. Use gradient clipping.
15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm.
16. Turn off gradient computation during validation.
17. Use input and batch normalization.

## 1. Consider using another learning rate schedule

The learning rate (schedule) you choose has a large impact on the speed of convergence as well as the generalization performance of your model.

Cyclical Learning Rates and the 1Cycle learning rate schedule are both methods introduced by Leslie N. Smith ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)), and then popularised by fast.ai's Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger ([here](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) and [here](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb)). Essentially, the 1Cycle learning rate schedule looks something like this:

The maximum should be the value picked with the Learning Rate Finder, and the lower one can be ten times lower. Then, the length of this cycle should be slightly less than the total number of epochs, and, in the last part of training, we should allow the learning rate to decrease more than the minimum, by several orders of magnitude.

In the best case this schedule achieves a massive speed-up – what Smith calls *Superconvergence* – as compared to conventional learning rate schedules. Using the 1Cycle policy he needs \~10x fewer training iterations of a ResNet-56 on ImageNet to match the performance of the original paper, for instance). The schedule seems to perform robustly well across common architectures and optimizers.

PyTorch implements both of these methods `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR,` see [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).

One drawback of these schedulers is that they introduce a number of additional hyperparameters. [This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-techniques-in-deep-learning-4dad592c63c8) and [this repo](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder), offer a nice overview and implementation of how good hyper-parameters can be found including the Learning Rate Finder mentioned above.

Why does this work? It doesn't seem entirely clear but one[ possible explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) might be that regularly increasing the learning rate helps to traverse [saddle points in the loss landscape ](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/430c3626b879b4005d41b8a46172e0c0-Paper.pdf)more quickly.

## 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader

When using [torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), set `num_workers > 0`, rather than the default value of 0, and `pin_memory=True`, rather than the default value of False. Details of this are [explained here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html).

[Szymon Micacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a 2x speed-up for a single training epoch by using four workers and pinned memory.

A rule of thumb that [people are using ](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader/813/5)to choose the number of workers is to set it to four times the number of available GPUs with both a larger and smaller number of workers leading to a slow down.

Note that increasing num\_workerswill increase your CPU memory consumption.

## 3. Max out the batch size

This is a somewhat contentious point. Generally, however, it seems like using the largest batch size your GPU memory permits will accelerate your training (see [NVIDIA's Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf), for instance). Note that you will also have to adjust other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, if you modify the batch size. A rule of thumb here is to double the learning rate as you double the batch size.

[OpenAI has a nice empirical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06162.pdf) on the number of convergence steps needed for different batch sizes. [Daniel Huynh](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-batch-size-finder-in-fastai-how-to-get-a-4x-speedup-with-better-generalization-813d686f6bdf) runs some experiments with different batch sizes (also using the 1Cycle policy discussed above) where he achieves a 4x speed-up by going from batch size 64 to 512.

[One of the downsides](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) of using large batch sizes, however, is that they might lead to solutions that generalize worse than those trained with smaller batches.

## 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

The release of PyTorch 1.6 included a native implementation of Automatic Mixed Precision training to PyTorch. The main idea here is that certain operations can be run faster and without a loss of accuracy at semi-precision (FP16) rather than in the single-precision (FP32) used elsewhere. AMP, then, automatically decide which operation should be executed in which format. This allows both for faster training and a smaller memory footprint.

In the best case, the usage of AMP would look something like this:

    import torch
    # Creates once at the beginning of training
    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()
    
    for data, label in data_iter:
       optimizer.zero_grad()
       # Casts operations to mixed precision
       with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
          loss = model(data)
    
       # Scales the loss, and calls backward()
       # to create scaled gradients
       scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    
       # Unscales gradients and calls
       # or skips optimizer.step()
       scaler.step(optimizer)
    
       # Updates the scale for next iteration
       scaler.update()

Benchmarking a number of common language and vision models on NVIDIA V100 GPUs, [Huang and colleagues find](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) that using AMP over regular FP32 training yields roughly 2x – but upto 5.5x – training speed-ups.

Currently, only CUDA ops can be autocast in this way. See the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html#op-eligibility) here for more details on this and other limitations.

u/SVPERBlA points out that you can squeeze out some additional performance (\~ 20%) from AMP on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs if you convert your tensors to the [Channels Last memory format](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html). Refer to [this section](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-convolutional/index.html#tensor-layout) in the NVIDIA docs for an explanation of the speedup and more about NCHW versus NHWC tensor formats.

## 5. Consider using another optimizer

AdamW is Adam with weight decay (rather than L2-regularization) which was popularized by fast.ai and is now available natively in PyTorch as `torch.optim.AdamW`. AdamW seems to consistently outperform Adam in terms of both the error achieved and the training time. See [this excellent blog](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) post on why using weight decay instead of L2-regularization makes a difference for Adam.

Both Adam and AdamW work well with the 1Cycle policy described above.

There are also a few not-yet-native optimizers that have received a lot of attention recently, most notably LARS ([pip installable implementation](https://github.com/kakaobrain/torchlars)) and [LAMB](https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb).

NVIDA's APEX implements fused versions of a number of common optimizers such as [Adam](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/optimizers.html). This implementation avoid a number of passes to and from GPU memory as compared to the PyTorch implementation of Adam, yielding speed-ups in the range of 5%.

## 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking

If your model architecture remains fixed and your input size stays constant, setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` might be beneficial ([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/backends.html#torch-backends-cudnn)). This enables the cudNN autotuner which will benchmark a number of different ways of computing convolutions in cudNN and then use the fastest method from then on.

For a rough reference on the type of speed-up you can expect from this, [Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a speed-up of 70% on a forward pass for a convolution and a 27% speed-up for a forward + backward pass of the same convolution.

One caveat here is that this autotuning might become very slow if you max out the batch size as mentioned above.

## 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs

Beware of frequently transferring tensors from a GPU to a CPU using `tensor.cpu()` and vice versa using `tensor.cuda()` as these are relatively expensive. The same applies for `.item()` and `.numpy()` – use `.detach()` instead.

If you are creating a new tensor, you can also directly assign it to your GPU using the keyword argument `device=torch.device('cuda:0')`.

If you do need to transfer data, using `.to(non_blocking=True)`, might be useful [as long as you don't have any synchronization points](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/should-we-set-non-blocking-to-true/38234/4) after the transfer.

If you really have to, you might want to give Santosh Gupta's [SpeedTorch](https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/SpeedTorch) a try, although it doesn't seem entirely clear when this actually does/doesn't provide speed-ups.

## 8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing

Quoting directly from the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html):

>Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations, and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part of a model.  
>  
>Specifically, in the forward pass, function will run in [torch.no\_grad()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html#torch.no_grad) manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the functionparameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and function is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on function again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then the gradients are calculated using these activation values.

So while this will might slightly increase your run time for a given batch size, you'll significantly reduce your memory footprint. This in turn will allow you to further increase the batch size you're using allowing for better GPU utilization.

While checkpointing is implemented natively as `torch.utils.checkpoint`([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html)), it does seem to take some thought and effort to implement properly. Priya Goyal [has a good tutorial ](https://github.com/prigoyal/pytorch_memonger/blob/master/tutorial/Checkpointing_for_PyTorch_models.ipynb)demonstrating some of the key aspects of checkpointing.

## 9. Use gradient accumulation

Another approach to increasing the batch size is to accumulate gradients across multiple `.backward()` passes before calling optimizer.step().

Following [a post](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) by Hugging Face's Thomas Wolf, gradient accumulation can be implemented as follows:

    model.zero_grad()                                   # Reset gradients tensors
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set):
        predictions = model(inputs)                     # Forward pass
        loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)       # Compute loss function
        loss = loss / accumulation_steps                # Normalize our loss (if averaged)
        loss.backward()                                 # Backward pass
        if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:             # Wait for several backward steps
            optimizer.step()                            # Now we can do an optimizer step
            model.zero_grad()                           # Reset gradients tensors
            if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0:           # Evaluate the model when we...
                evaluate_model()                        # ...have no gradients accumulate

This method was developed mainly to circumvent GPU memory limitations and I'm not entirely clear on the trade-off between having additional `.backward()` loops. [This discussion](https://forums.fast.ai/t/accumulating-gradients/33219/28) on the fastai forum seems to suggest that it can in fact accelerate training, so it's probably worth a try.

## 10. Use Distributed Data Parallel for multi-GPU training

Methods to accelerate distributed training probably warrant their own post but one simple one is to use `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` rather than `torch.nn.DataParallel`. By doing so, each GPU will be driven by a dedicated CPU core avoiding the GIL issues of DataParallel.

In general, I can strongly recommend reading the [documentation on distributed training.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html)

## 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0

Use `.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` rather than `.zero_grad()`.

Doing so will let the memory allocator handle the gradients rather than actively setting them to 0. This will lead to yield a *modest* speed-up as they say in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html), so don't expect any miracles.

Watch out, doing this is not side-effect free! Check the docs for the details on this.

## 12. Use .as_tensor() rather than .tensor()

`torch.tensor()` always copies data. If you have a numpy array that you want to convert, use `torch.as_tensor()` or `torch.from_numpy()` to avoid copying the data.

## 13. Turn on debugging tools only when actually needed

PyTorch offers a number of useful debugging tools like the [autograd.profiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#profiler), [autograd.grad\_check](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#numerical-gradient-checking), and [autograd.anomaly\_detection](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#anomaly-detection). Make sure to use them to better understand when needed but to also turn them off when you don't need them as they will slow down your training.

## 14. Use gradient clipping

Originally used to avoid exploding gradients in RNNs, there is both some [empirical evidence as well as some theoretical support](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgnXpVYwS) that clipping gradients (roughly speaking: `gradient = min(gradient, threshold)`) accelerates convergence.

Hugging Face's [Transformer implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7729ef738161a0a182b172fcb7c351f6d2b9c50d/examples/run_squad.py#L156) is a really clean example of how to use gradient clipping as well as some of the other methods such as AMP mentioned in this post.

In PyTorch this can be done using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)).

It's not entirely clear to me which models benefit how much from gradient clipping but it seems to be robustly useful for RNNs, Transformer-based and ResNets architectures and a range of different optimizers.

## 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm

This is a very simple one: turn off the bias of layers before BatchNormalization layers. For a 2-D convolutional layer, this can be done by setting the bias keyword to False: `torch.nn.Conv2d(..., bias=False, ...)`.  (Here's a r[eminder why this makes sense](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46256747/can-not-use-both-bias-and-batch-normalization-in-convolution-layers).)

You will save some parameters, I would however expect the speed-up of this to be relatively small as compared to some of the other methods mentioned here.

## 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation

This one is straightforward: set `torch.no_grad()` during validation.

## 17. Use input and batch normalization

You're probably already doing this but you might want to double-check:

* Are you [normalizing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) your input?
* Are you using [batch-normalization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)?

And [here's](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/437840/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc) a reminder of why you probably should.

### Bonus tip from the comments: Use JIT to fuse point-wise operations.

If you have adjacent point-wise operations you can use [PyTorch JIT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#creating-torchscript-code) to combine them into one FusionGroup which can then be launched on a single kernel rather than multiple kernels as would have been done per default. You'll also save some memory reads and writes.

[Szymon Migacz shows](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) how you can use the `@torch.jit.script` decorator to fuse the operations in a GELU, for instance:

    @torch.jit.script
    def fused_gelu(x):
        return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x / 1.41421))

In this case, fusing the operations leads to a 5x speed-up for the execution of `fused_gelu`  
as compared to the unfused version.

See also [this post](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/) for an example of how Torchscript can be used to accelerate an RNN.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

•	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.

&nbsp;

•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng’s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps.

This is a good lesson for data scientists. Zillow made a huge bet on their housing price prediction algorithm and lost billions in the process (at least 32 Billion in market cap).

Just because your algorithm predicts well in a test environment, doesn't mean other intangible factors can derail it in the real world. In this case, seller's feelings, housing layout, and local market conditions.

My question is, where was the pilot in this? This seems like executives got too eager to use this and pushed it out on a massive scale without getting enough feedback. Also, overall market conditions could have caused some bias here, rewarding poor decision making when prices were skyrocketing over the past year, and now that the market is more saturated, reality is setting in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qwqbxn/zillow_loses_billions_on_house_price_prediction/,Zillow Loses Billions on House Price Prediction Algorithm,Discussion,705,185,0.98
f29l4v,MachineLearning,1581433708.0,"**Blog Post:** [https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/](https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/)

**Summary:** The Udacity Self Driving Car dataset (5,100 stars and 1,800 forks) contains thousands of unlabeled vehicles, hundreds of unlabeled pedestrians, and dozens of unlabeled cyclists. Of the 15,000 images, I found (and corrected) issues with 4,986 (33%) of them.

**Commentary:**  
This is really scary. I discovered this because we're working on converting and re-hosting popular datasets in many popular formats for easy use across models... I first noticed that there were a bunch of completely unlabeled images.

Upon digging in, I was appalled to find that fully 1/3 of the images contained errors or omissions! Some are small (eg a part of a car on the edge of the frame or a ways in the distance not being labeled) but some are egregious (like the woman in the crosswalk with a baby stroller).

I think this really calls out the importance of rigorously inspecting any data you plan to use with your models. Garbage in, garbage out... and self-driving cars should be treated seriously.

I went ahead and corrected by hand the missing bounding boxes and fixed a bunch of other errors like phantom annotations and duplicated boxes. There are still quite a few duplicate boxes (especially around traffic lights) that would have been tedious to fix manually, but if there's enough demand I'll go back and clean those as well.

mbhewa,MachineLearning,1616513807.0,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I’m going to leave out the basic things because there’s enough posts about them, i’m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.

I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4&reddit_posts) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/landing/reddit_posts) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the takeaways:

# Neural Network Training Fundamentals

* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**
   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset
   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc…
* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data
* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models
   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn’t then you have a bug!
   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!
* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first
* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**
   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN
   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range

# Transfer Learning

* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task
   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP
* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model
   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one
   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)

# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting

* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods
* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:
   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images
   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)
* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints
* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction

# Other Tricks to Improve Performance

* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input
* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**
* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate
* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!
* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit
* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set
* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range
   * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value)
* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance
* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)
* **Don’t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem
* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)
* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful
* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface

hipozj,datascience,1593531525.0,"Hello everyone,

I have been browsing this and other related subs (r/cscareerquestionsEU, r/datascience, etc) for a long time now looking for advice on my journey to find a full-time job and our field in general. I graduated from my Master's program (major in ML, from a top tier university in Germany) this year in March and have been looking for full-time positions in the area for about 6 months now. Today I had a Zoom interview with a company (eCommerce) I had been in touch with for the past couple of weeks and about an hour ago, they called me saying they were really impressed and the job is basically mine if I want it. I am absolutely elated.

To give an idea about my job search process if it gives anyone a perspective being in a similar position, I applied for a total of 222 positions in the areas of Data Science, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and a handful of Software Development positions as well (CV was same for every application and cover letter was modified a little bit depending on the company - in most cases, it was also the same. Perhaps that explains so many straight-up rejections).

**Ghosted:** 118.

**Outright rejections**: 68.

**Rejections after the technical stage**: 14.

**Still in the process** (applied less than 10 days ago and haven't heard): 22.

**Offers**: 2 (the other one is ML Engineer).

&#x200B;

I feel I am a little above average when it comes to programming but I do have a theoretical understanding of ML algorithms (master's helped), so that helped in some interviews. Regarding the choice between the offers, I feel I am gonna go with the Data Engineering one since there is a lot of room to learn new frameworks which I did not experience in academia (PySpark, Airflow, etc.), there is room to turn into a Data Scientist as the project continues and because the location is excellent.

There were a few days where I was really depressed about my rejections (especially when I got one or two emails in the morning) but I made myself resilient by thinking that the rejections don't matter much (especially the ones given without any interview) and kept on learning and applying. If you are in a similar position, keep on going. Things will turn for the better. :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to add a couple of things since this post is getting a bit of attention. I had a grade of 1.7/5 (in Europe/Germany, 1 is the best you can have and 4 is the worst; anything lower is failing) in my Master's. I had one and a half years of part-time working experience and I was a Teaching Assistant for two years for an ML/DL course in my program.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hipozj/landed_my_first_full_time_job_today_data/,Landed my first full time job today - Data Engineering,Job Search,696,189,0.98

I've just spent the last 9 weeks building what I hope is the simplest way to scrape data from a webpage: [Simplescraper](http://simplescraper.io).

All you gotta do is click on the data you want, give it a name and then view results. If all goes well your data is waiting for you to download in csv or Json format. There's also cloud scraping built in for bigger jobs.

There are dozens of web scrapers out there but none of them seem to nail ease of use *and* a good UI. Hopefully it brings value to some of you 🤞.

> http://www. learnanimals . com/gray-bat/gray-bat.gif

> http://www. pixelbirds .co . uk/webnyct1.jpg

> http://www. pixelbirds .co . uk/webmarot2.jpg

But when I posted my find to this subreddit a few days ago, individuals had trouble reproducing my find. I assumed this meant it was a false positive, but decided to dig into why that might be. I sent Microsoft the files saying they were a false positive, and they responded saying that the files were indeed malicious. The IP addresses for the malicious files point to hosts that have been compromised numerous times in the past according to a quick search.

I believe there are two versions of gray-bat.gif, with one containing the malware and the other is completely clean. Somewhere along the line, a check is performed to determine what file to give the user requesting it and that's why some people end up with a file that doesn't contain malware. I don't know exactly what it checks for, but using wget seems to reliably get the malicious file.

When looking at this URL:

> http://www. learnanimals . com/gray-bat/gray-bat.gif

I find that it has a redirect to this page:

> http://www. learnanimals . com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi 

This suspendedpage.cgi page has HTML code that contains a redirect to a URL that I suspect contains the malicious file:

I haven't been able to find out if/how the other two images work and I don't know what the malicious code is doing. I could be completely wrong about this, so keep that in mind.

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/,"So many people disappointed with their jobs.

This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions.

m71ijk,datascience,1615990949.0,"Imposter syndrome comes up in this sub a lot, and as someone who feels like he has (mostly) learned to manage it, I wanted to share my experience with it - and what was ultimately my major breakthrough.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

1. You are a generally competent person
2. There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you *and that's ok and expected.* Even more importantly: you're not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough you're going to find people that are better than you at everything you do *and that's ok.*
3. You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn't be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals - generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else. 

In that order.

I think that, generally, imposter syndrome shows up in a thought cycle that goes the opposite direction. That is:

1. You don't have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
2. You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don't have time to learn
3. You feel incompetent

So when you feel that, flip it: 

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person - if you weren't, you wouldn't have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that's graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the 'drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them - that's just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn't diminish your value - it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn - and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

\* As an anecdote - my first encounter with this scenario was a professor that literally did everything I liked doing - but better. He was a tenured professor at a top school, he had come \*this\* close to being a professional soccer player, and he was a classically trained musician, was in incredibly shape for his age and was a generally charming dude. I was a fumbling grad student who played recreational soccer poorly and played in a shitty metal band that no one ever went to see play, out of shape and generally a not-so-charming dude. 

It made me *incredibly* self-conscious for about a minute until I realized ""wait up... this guy is just an abject abnormality of humanity. I shouldn't feel bad about myself, I should just be impressed by how smart and accomplished this guy is *because 99.99999% of the population would be looking up at him too"".*

That helped me later in life when I would encounter people who I felt were just fundamentally smarter people than me. In particular, I remember hiring someone for my team that was so smart and thinking ""there is a better chance that I am going to be working for her in 10 years than the other way around"" *and being ok with that.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m71ijk/imposter_syndrome_and_prioritizing_what_to_learn/,Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,,670,90,0.99

I have access to Python and R and I am equally skilled in both, but I always find myself falling back to the beautiful Tidyverse of dplyr, stringr, pipes and friends over pandas. The real game changer for me is the %>% pipe operator, it's wonderful to work with. I can do all preprocessing in one long chain without making a single variable, while in pandas I find myself swamped with df, df_no_nulls, df_no_nulls_norm etc. etc. (INB4 choose better variable names but you get my point). The best part about the chain is that it is completely debuggable as it's not nested. The group_by/summarise/mutate/filter grammar is really really good at it's job in comparison to pandas, particularly mutate. The only thing I wish R had that Python has is list comprehension, but there are a ton of things I wish pandas did better that R's Tidyverse does. 

Of course, all the good ML frameworks are written in Python that blows R out of the water further down the pipeline.

gonna8,MachineLearning,1590168394.0,"I understand how mind blowing the potential of deep learning is, but the truth is, majority of companies in the world dont care about it, or do not need that level of machine learning expertise.

If we want to democratize machine learning we have to acknowledge the fact the most people Learning all the cool generative neural networks will not end up working for Google or Facebook.

What I see is that most youngsters join this bandwagon of machine learning with hopes of working on these mind-blowing ideas, but when they do get a job at a descent company with a good pay, but are asked to produce ""medicore"" models, they feel like losers.
I dont know when, but somewhere in this rush of deep learning, the spirit of it all got lost.

Since when did the people who use Gradient Boosting, Logistic regression, Random Forest became oldies and medicore.

The result is that, most of the guys we interwiew for a role know very little about basics and hardly anything about the underlying maths.
The just know how to use the packages on already prepared data.

Update : Thanks for all the comments, this discussion has really been enlightening for me and an amazing experience, given its my first post in reddit.
Thanks a lot for the Gold Award, it means a lot to me.

Just to respond to some of the popular questions and opinions in the comments.

1. Do we expect people to have to remember all the maths of the machine learning?

No ways, i dont remember 99% of what i studied in college. But thats not the point. When applying these algorithms, one must know the underlying principles of it, and not just which python library they need to import.

2. Do I mean people should not work on Deep Learning or not make a hype of it, as its not the best thing?

Not at all, Deep Learning is the frontier of Machine Learning and its the mind blowing potential of deep learning which brought most of us into the domain.
All i meant was, in this rush to apply deep learning to everything, we must not lose sight of simpler models, which most companies across the world still use and would continue to use due to there interpretability.

3. What do I mean by Democratization of ML.

ML is a revolutionary knowledge, we can all agree on that, and therefore it is essential that such knowledge be made available to all the people, so they can learn about its potential and benifit from the changes it brings to there lives, rather then being intimidated by it.

lvwt3l,MachineLearning,1614671503.0,"I come from a traditional engineering field, and here is my observation about ML publication practice lately:

I have noticed that there are groups of researchers working on the intersection of ""old"" fields such as optimization, control, signal processing and the like, who will all of a sudden publish a massive amount of paper that purports to solve a certain problem. The problem itself is usually recent and sometimes involves some deep neural network.

However, upon close examination, the only novelty is the problem (usually proposed by other unaffiliated groups) but not the method proposed by the researchers that purports to solve it.

I was puzzled by why a very large amount of seemingly weak papers, literally rehashing (occasionally, well-known) techniques from the 1980s or even 60s are getting accepted, and I noticed the following recipe:

1. **Only ML conferences.** These groups of researchers will only ever publish in machine learning conferences (and not to optimization and control conferences/journals, where the heart of their work might actually lie). For example, on a paper about adversarial machine learning, the entire paper was actually about solving an optimization problem, but the optimization routine is basically a slight variation of other well studied methods. ***Update***: I also noticed that if a paper does not go through NeurIPS or ICLR, they will be directly sent to AAAI and some other smaller name conferences, where they will be accepted. So nothing goes to waste in this field.
2. **Peers don't know what's going on.** Through openreview, I found that the reviewers (not just the researchers) are uninformed about their particular area, and only seem to comment on the correctness of the paper, but not the novelty. In fact, I doubt the reviewers themselves know about the novelty of the method. ***Update***: by novelty I meant how novel it is with respect to the state-of-the-art of a certain technique, especially when it intersects with operations research, optimization, control, signal processing. The state-of-the-art *could be* far ahead than what mainstream ML folks know about.
3. **Poor citation practices.** Usually the researchers will only cite themselves or other ""machine learning people"" (whatever this means) from the last couple of years. Occasionally, there will be 1 citation from hundreds of years ago attributed to Cauchy, Newton, Fourier, Cournot, Turing, Von Neumann and the like, and then a hundred year jump to 2018 or 2019. I see, ""This problem was studied by *some big name* in 1930 and *Random Guy XYZ* in 2018"" a lot.
4. **Wall of math.** Frequently, there will be a massive wall of math, proving some esoteric condition on the eigenvalue, gradient, Jacobian, and other curious things about their problem (under other esoteric assumptions). There will be several theorems, none of which are applicable because the moment they run their highly non-convex deep learning application, all conditions are violated. Hence the only thing obtained from these intricate theorems + math wall are some faint intuition (which are violated immediately). And then nothing is said. 

***Update***: If I could add one more, it would be that certain techniques, after being proposed, and after the authors claim that it beats a lot of benchmarks, will be seemingly be abandoned and never used again. ML researchers seem to like to jump around topics a lot, so that might be a factor. But usually in other fields, once a technique is proposed, it is refined by the same group of researchers over many years, sometimes over the course of a researcher's career.

In some ways, this makes certain area of ML sort of an echo chamber, where researchers are pushing through a large amount of known results rehashed and somewhat disguised by the novelty of their problem and these papers are all getting accepted because no one can detect the lack of novelty (or when they do detect, it is only 1 guy out of 3 reviewers). I just feel like ML conferences are sort of being treated as some sort of automatic paper acceptance cash cow.

jpljoo,datascience,1604728081.0,"It's wild to think it's been a year since I first became a data scientist, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned so far.

**1. The Data Science Title Is Meaningless**

I still have no idea what a ""typical"" data scientist is, and many companies have no idea either. A data science role is very dependent on the company and the maturity of their data infrastructure. Instead of a title, focus on what business problems are present for a particular company and how your skillset in data can solve it. Want to build data products? Then chase those business problems! Interested in using deep learning? Find companies with the infrastructure and problems that warrant such methods. Chasing data problems instead of titles will put you in a better place.

**2. Ask More Questions Before Coding**

I've been burned a few times learning that most non-data people have no idea what data solution they need. Jumping straight into coding after getting a request will set you up for failure. Take a step back and ask probing questions for further clarification. Many times you will find that someone will ask for ""ABC"" but after further questions they actually need ""XYZ"". This skill of getting clarity and consensus among stakeholders, regarding data problems and solutions, is such an important facet of being an effective data scientist.

**3. Prototype to Build Buy In**

Start with a simple example, get feedback, implement feedback, then repeat. This process saves you time and makes your stakeholders feel heard/valued. For example, I recently had to create an algorithm to classify our product's users. Rather than jumping straight into python, I created a slide deck describing the algorithms logic visually and an excel spreadsheet of different use cases. I presented these prototypes to stakeholders and then implemented their feedback into the prototype. By the end of this process it was clear as to what I needed to code and the stakeholders understood what value my data solution would bring to them.

**4. Talk to Domain Experts**

You end up making A LOT of assumptions about the data. Talking to domain experts of your data subject and or product will help you make better assumptions. Go talk to Sales or Customer Success teams to learn about customer pain points. Talk to engineers to learn why certain product decisions were made. If it's a specific domain, talk to a subject matter expert to learn whether there is an important nuance about the data or if it's a data quality issue.

**5. Learn Software Engineering Best Practices**

Notebooks are awesome for experimenting and data exploration, but they can only take you so far. Learn how to build scripts for your data science workflow instead of just using notebooks. Take advantage of git to keep track of your code. Write unit tests to make sure your code is working as expected. Put effort into how you structure your code (e.g. functions, separate scripts, etc.). This will help you stand out as a data scientist, as well as make it way easier to put your data solutions into production.

There is probably more, but these are the topics top of mind for me right now! Would love to hear what other data scientist have learned as well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jpljoo/first_year_as_a_data_scientist_reflection/,First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,Career,661,44,0.98
ecchg8,MachineLearning,1576674997.0,"A few weeks ago, the .comdom app was released by Telenet, a large Belgian telecom provider. The app aims to make sexting safer, by overlaying a private picture with a visible watermark that contains the receiver's name and phone number. As such, a receiver is discouraged to leak nude pictures.

[Example of watermarked image](https://preview.redd.it/q4fremfttd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e571ddecc4e6021fa332b9ddf5f7c2ef9f5a81ec)

The .comdom app claims to provide a safer alternative than apps such as Snapchat and Confide, which have functions such as screenshot-proofing and self-destructing messages or images. These functions only provide the illusion of security. For example, it's simple to capture the screen of your smartphone using another camera, and thus cirumventing the screenshot-proofing and self-destruction of the private images. However, we found that the .comdom app only *increases* the illusion of security.

In a matter of days, we (IDLab-MEDIA from Ghent University) were able to automatically remove these visible watermarks from images. We watermarked thousands of random pictures in the same way that the .comdom app does, and provided those to a simple convolutional neural network with these images. As such, the AI algorithm learns to perform some form of image inpainting.

[Unwatermarked image, using our machine learning algorithm](https://preview.redd.it/ykkf8d5pyd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca105a86175e1a008b0348e7e1ab9aa5f9dd2733)

Thus, the developers of the .comdom have underestimated the power of modern AI technologies.

We’re part of the research team behind CICERO, Meta AI’s latest research in cooperative AI. CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players.   Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games.   Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:

* **NLP x RL/Planning:** CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine. 
* **Controlling dialogue via plans:** In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO’s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.
* **Selecting plans:** CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.
* **Filtering messages:** We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO’s messages. 
* **Human-like play:** Over the course of 72 hours of play – which involved sending 5,277 messages – CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.

-----------

I'm only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.

It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. [There][1] were at least [four][2] [review][3] [papers][4] just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we're also focusing on some incorrect places.

But first, let's take a step back and go over the basics.

# Models are about compression

We say graphs are a ""non-euclidean"" data type, but that's not really true. A regular graph is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the [adjacency matrix][5], like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif).

It's weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it ""non-euclidean"".

This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, *where the non-zero numbers are* matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.

**If you had the full matrix, life would be easy**

If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn't a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.

First, network node embeddings aren't a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it's already a vector of numbers.

Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we're attaching to nodes.

**NLP is also just fancy matrix compression**

Let's take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be [thought of in terms of graphs][6] as we'll see, so it's not a big digression.

First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like [Word2Vec][7] and [GloVe][8] are [just matrix factorization][9].

The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old [bag of words][10] matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) [co-occurence][11] graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.

Glove then does matrix factorization on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent.

You can read more on this in my [post on embeddings][12] and the one (with code) on [word embeddings][13].

**Even language models are also just matrix compression**

Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the [state of the art][14] in NLP.

Let's take BERT as our main example. BERT predicts a word given the context of the [rest of the sentence](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png).

This grows the matrix we're factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence's context, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png)

We're growing the ""ideal matrix"" we're factoring combinatorially. As noted by [Hanh & Futrell][15]:

> [...] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the [Kolmogorov Complexity][16] sense. It's also possible that huge language models just [memorize a lot of it][17] rather than compress the information, for what it's worth.

### Can we upsample any graph like language models do?

We're already doing it.

Let's call a **first-order** embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph's adjacency matrix or [Laplacian matrix][18]. If you embed a graph using [Laplacian Eigenmaps][19] or by taking the [principal components][20] of the Laplacian, that's first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is [ProNE][21], which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.

A **higher-order** method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. [GraRep][22], shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix.

Higher order method are the ""upsampling"" we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.

# Where are the performance gain?

Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.

As noted in the [OpenGraphsBenchmark][4] (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can't seriously differentiate between methods.

Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.

**Performance matters by task**

One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you're doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there [isn't much gained][23] from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings (This makes sense, because the full context of the sentence is captured in the sentence co-occurence matrix that is generating the Word2Vec embeddings).

Similarly, [I find][24] that for many graphs **simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods**. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases.

Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my [GGVec with order=1][25].

Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks. I'm not the only one to find this. In the BioNEV paper, they find: ""A large GraRep order value for link prediction tasks (e.g. 3, 4);a small value for node classification tasks (e.g.1, 2)"" (p.9).

Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to [real world graphs][26].

For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by [Owen Cornec][27] created by first embedding the graph to 32-300 dimensions using a node embedding algorithm, then mapping this to 2d or 3d with the excellent UMAP algorithm, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png)

Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there's an instance of it in the OGB paper).

The problem here is that **we don't know when any method is better than another** and **we definitely don't know the reason**.

There's definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.

A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because...

# Academic incentives work against progress

Here's the cynic's view of how machine learning papers are made:

1.  Take an existing algorithm
2.  Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters
3.  Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped
4.  Absolutely don't gridsearch stuff you're comparing against in your results section
5.  Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github (Or no code at all!) and bask in the citations

I'm [not][28] the [only one][29] with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it's gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.

### Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec

A side project of mine is a [node embedding library][25] and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don't use Node2Vec.

[Node2Vec][30] with `p=1; q=1` is the [Deepwalk][31] algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.

The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.

This is not academic fraud -- the hyperparameters [do help a tiny bit][32] if you gridsearch really hard. But it's the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn't deserve 7500 citations.

# Progress is all about practical issues

We've known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with [AlexNet][33] in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was **practical**.

Similarly, we've known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.

But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware.

It's hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You're disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google's original search algorithm [initially ran on commodity hardware][34].

**Efficiency is paramount to progress**

The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in [efficiency][35] as well as much better libraries and hardware support.

**Academic code is terrible**

Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on `p` and `q` is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself (on number of walks, length of walks, or word2vec hyperparameters). The problem is that people don't gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.

I wrote the [Nodevectors library][36] to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took **32 hours** to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It's no wonder people don't gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.

To give an example, in the original paper of [GraphSAGE][37] they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5, which is horrid if you've ever hyperparameter tuned a deepwalk algorithm. From their paper:

> We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for >1000× longer than the other approaches (in terms of wall clock time for prediction on the test set) I don't even think the GraphSAGE authors had bad intent -- deepwalk implementations are simply so awful that they're turned away from using it properly. It's like trying to do deep learning with 2002 deep learning libraries and hardware.

# Your architectures don't really matter

One of the more important papers this year was [OpenAI's ""Scaling laws""][38] paper, where the raw number of parameters in your model is the most predictive feature of overall performance. This was noted even in the original BERT paper and drives 2020's increase in absolutely massive language models.

This is really just [Sutton' Bitter Lesson][39] in action:

> General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin

Transformers might be [replacing convolution][40], too. As [Yannic Kilcher said][41], transformers are ruining everything. [They work on graphs][6], in fact it's one of the [recent approaches][42], and seems to be one of the more succesful [when benchmarked][1]

Researchers seem to be putting so much effort into architecture, but it doesn't matter much in the end because you can approximate anything by stacking more layers.

Efficiency wins are great -- but neural net architectures are just one way to achieve that, and by tremendously over-researching this area we're leaving a lot of huge gains elsewhere on the table.

# Current Graph Data Structure Implementations suck

NetworkX is a bad library. I mean, it's good if you're working on tiny graphs for babies, but for anything serious it chokes and forces you to rewrite everything in... what library, really?

At this point most people working on large graphs end up hand-rolling some data structure. This is tough because your computer's memory is a 1-dimensional array of 1's and 0's and a graph has no obvious 1-d mapping.

This is even harder when we take updating the graph (adding/removing some nodes/edges) into account. Here's a few options:

### Disconnected networks of pointers

NetworkX is the best example. Here, every node is an object with a list of pointers to other nodes (the node's edges).

This layout is like a linked list. Linked lists are the [root of all performance evil][43].

Linked lists go completely against how modern computers are designed. Fetching things from memory is slow, and operating on memory is fast (by two orders of magnitude). Whenever you do anything in this layout, you make a roundtrip to RAM. It's slow by design, you can write this in Ruby or C or assembly and it'll be slow regardless, because memory fetches are slow in hardware.

The main advantage of this layout is that adding a new node is O(1). So if you're maintaining a massive graph where adding and removing nodes happens as often as reading from the graph, it makes sense.

Another advantage of this layout is that it ""scales"". Because everything is decoupled from each other you can put this data structure on a cluster. However, you're really creating a complex solution for a problem you created for yourself.

### Sparse Adjacency Matrix

This layout great for read-only graphs. I use it as the backend in my [nodevectors][25] library, and many other library writers use the [Scipy CSR Matrix][44], you can see graph algorithms implemented on it [here][45].

The most popular layout for this use is the [CSR Format][46] where you have 3 arrays holding the graph. One for edge destinations, one for edge weights and an ""index pointer"" which says which edges come from which node.

Because the CSR layout is simply 3 arrays, it scales on a single computer: a CSR matrix can be laid out on a disk instead of in-memory. You simply [memory map][47] the 3 arrays and use them on-disk from there.

With modern NVMe drives random seeks aren't slow anymore, much faster than distributed network calls like you do when scaling the linked list-based graph. I haven't seen anyone actually implement this yet, but it's in the roadmap for my implementation at least.

The problem with this representation is that adding a node or edge means rebuilding the whole data structure.

### Edgelist representations

This representation is three arrays: one for the edge sources, one for the edge destinations, and one for edge weights. [DGL][48] uses this representation internally.

This is a simple and compact layout which can be good for analysis.

The problem compared to CSR Graphs is some seek operations are slower. Say you want all the edges for node #4243. You can't jump there without maintaining an index pointer array.

So either you maintain sorted order and binary search your way there (O(log2n)) or unsorted order and linear search (O(n)).

This data structure can also work on memory mapped disk array, and node append is fast on unsorted versions (it's slow in the sorted version).

# Global methods are a dead end

Methods that work on the **entire graph at once** can't leverage computation, because they run out of RAM at a certain scale.

So any method that want a chance of being the new standard need to be able to update piecemeal on parts of the graph.

**Sampling-based methods**

Sampling Efficiency will matter more in the future

*   **Edgewise local methods**. The only algorithms I know of that do this are GloVe and GGVec, which they pass through an edge list and update embedding weights on each step. 

The problem with this approach is that it's hard to use them for higher-order methods. The advantage is that they easily scale even on one computer. Also, incrementally adding a new node is as simple as taking the existing embeddings, adding a new one, and doing another epoch over the data

*   **Random Walk sampling**. This is used by deepwalk and its descendants, usually for node embeddings rather than GNN methods. This can be computationally expensive and make it hard to add new nodes.

But this does scale, for instance [Instagram][49] use it to feed their recommendation system models

*   **Neighbourhood sampling**. This is currently the most common one in GNNs, and can be low or higher order depending on the neighborhood size. It also scales well, though implementing efficiently can be challenging.

It's currently used by [Pinterest][50]'s recommendation algorithms.

# Conclusion

Here are a few interesting questions:

*   What is the relation between graph types and methods?
*   Consolidated benchmarking like OGB
*   We're throwing random models at random benchmarks without understanding why or when they do better
*   More fundamental research. Heree's one I'm curious about: can other representation types like [Poincarre Embeddings][51] effectively encode directed relationships?

On the other hand, we should **stop focusing on** adding spicy new layers to test on the same tiny datasets. No one cares.

hecc72,datascience,1592909031.0,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

After a long beta, we are really excited to release [Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com/) to the public!

Connected papers is a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.

[https://www.connectedpapers.com/](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

I'm one of the creators, and in my work as a ML&CV engineer and team lead, almost every project involves a phase of literature review - trying to find the most similar work to the problem my team is trying to solve, or trying to track the relevant state of the art and apply it to our use case.

Connected Papers enables the researcher/engineer to explore paper-space in a much more efficient way. Given one paper that you think is relevant to your problem, it generates a visual graph of related papers in a way that makes it easy to see the most cited / recent / similar papers at a glance (Take a look at this [example graph](http://beta.connectedpapers.com:8050/main/9397e7acd062245d37350f5c05faf56e9cfae0d6/DeepFruits-A-Fruit-Detection-System-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks/graph) for a paper called ""DeepFruits: A Fruit Detection System Using Deep Neural Networks"").

gf9hrs,datascience,1588867985.0,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with.

Have a total of 5 YoE + STEM PhD which means this experience is probably not generalisable, but I hope these insights will be helpful for some. Just wanted to give back because I benefitted a lot from previous posts and resources, and the Data Science hiring process is not standardised, which makes it harder to find good information about companies. In fact I'm sure that the hiring process is not even standardized inside big companies.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training & fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python
4. Panel interview: 3 people from the team, focus on behavioural
5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning & stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

# On salary negotiations

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

uo589a,datascience,1652373471.0,"In April 2021, I got a 40% raise. That’s a pretty big raise.

But it didn’t make me feel very good. In fact, it made me realize that I had been leaving money on the table for almost two years.

I would never have got that raise unless I fought for it. Unless I typed the email and stuck my neck out, demanding what I was worth.

The experience taught me an important lesson:

Retention measures (like pay raises) are reactive, not proactive. If your company feels that you're happy there, they won’t pay you more.

In this post, I’m going to tell you that the data back this up, why this is the case, and what you can do about it.

**Salary compression**

Salary compression is what happens when companies don’t raise employees' salaries, but pay higher wages to attract new talent.

This imbalance between spending on new hires and existing workers has resulted in historic pay compression, with the gap between the wages of 20- to 24-year-olds (a reliable proxy for new hires) and 25- to 34-year-olds having shrunk to its smallest size in 36 years.

And this actually tends to impact the tech industry more so than others:

https://preview.redd.it/rmujs5im8zy81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2006ac9becb77372725a626a661118dfcf84ce62

TLDR: employers are giving way more money to new hires compared to their existing employees.

This is pretty surprising considering the cost of replacing someone is high. Companies have to:

1. Absorb hiring costs
2. Search in a competitive market for talent
3. Distract team members for another round of interviews
4. Deal with onboarding costs and lack of productivity for first three months of new hire

So why does this happen?

Here are two possible reasons:

**Possible Reason #1: Retention efforts take time**

Solid retention efforts and policies are the type of initiatives that are hard to measure and work over a long period of time, like 5 to 10 years.

And those are often things that can’t be prioritized because of the hypergrowth nature of the tech industry. Investors want to see results now.

Some companies will spend a lot of time and effort to pay the least amount of money they can per role. They take pride in that. It’s much easier to just bring new people in.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s the right way to think about the world if you want to be a great company.

**Possible Reason #2: Their career ladder strategy isn't developed**

One of the most common things that happens, especially at high growth startups, is that your workload increases beyond the tasks of your original role, but your salary doesn’t change.

Defining these internal career growth ladders is actually quite time consuming. And so if it’s not been well defined, then there’s no real precedent for you to get a raise.

In these cases, it’s not even the case that the company doesn’t want to give you a raise, it’s just that they haven’t done the work to establish what the next step looks like.

**What this means for you**

First, you need to realize that salary is just one element of your total compensation package. There are a *lot of* factors you can negotiate with that are outside of your base compensation. A quick list:

* Remote work
* Number of holidays
* Professional development opportunities
* Health and wellness benefits
* Bonuses
* Stock options or other long term incentives
* Your hours
* Projects you get to work on

Second, I encourage you to keep in mind that [money isn’t everything](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/motivators-hygiene-factors). It’s pretty cliché but if you’re learning a ton, I don’t think you need to keep money at the forefront of your mind.

For example, at my last company, the first 12 months were great. I was learning something new everyday and my salary didn’t matter too much to me, because I was in “learning” mode.

The 6 months after that, though, were rough. When I stopped enjoying my work, all the focus became about my salary. And when I got the raise that I wanted, I realized that I was staying for the wrong reasons.

So if you think the raise is going to solve your job satisfaction problems, keep in mind that it probably won’t.

But you deserve to get paid what you’re worth. And if you’re not, it’s time to change that.

Here are three principles you should keep in mind when negotiating a raise:

**Principle #1: It's all about the evidence**

Identify your [top two accomplishments](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) over the last 6-8 months. Pick ones that have a quantifiable impact. This is your ammunition.

Present this info however you want, but make it as easy as possible for your boss to vouch for you. Don’t make him do any unnecessary work - ideally, it should literally be him having to just forward the evidence you’ve presented (via a deck or a document) to his higher ups and then they discuss it.

Also have a clear salary number in mind. There’s plenty of ways to come up with a number - do research on sites like Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, H1BData, or maybe even reach out to others in the industry.

Once you have a clear number, bump it up by 15-20%.

**Principle #2: Keep your emotions out of it**

*“Anger is our friend. Not a nice friend. Not a gentle friend. But a very, very loyal friend… It will always tell us when we have betrayed ourselves.”* \- Julia Cameron, The Artist’s Way

Anger can be good. But it’s not in your best interests to be angry when negotiating.

Instead, you want to be firm and solution-oriented. That means that you’re not fighting against your boss or the company - you’re on the same team figuring out how you can do your best work.

For example, if you give a number and they come back with one that you’re unhappy with, instead of getting angry you can simply respond: “That doesn’t work for me. I’m curious how you arrived at that number. Can we walk through it?”

When you keep your emotions out of it, you’ll focus on how the promotion benefits **them** first and not you. And that’s what they want to hear.

**Principle #3: Timing matters**

If you have a performance review coming up in 3 months, don’t wait for 2.5 months to bring up your desire for a raise. Start early. Your boss will need time.

Two other tips:

1/ Try bringing this up after you’ve successfully completed a great project. Recency bias is real.

2/ If you’re purely trying to maximize your money, the way to do it is to get a competing offer and ask your current company to match it or go above. But you’ve got to be prepared to leave. High risk, high reward.

\*\*\*

One last thing.

No one is waking up every day thinking, “Is Shikhar happy in his job? Is he appreciated? Is he fairly compensated?”

I owe it to myself to advocate being paid fairly for my work.

As do you. So go make it happen.

cok47z,MachineLearning,1565454271.0,"A victim of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein testified that she was forced to have sex with MIT professor Marvin Minsky, as revealed in a newly unsealed deposition. Epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 as part of a controversial plea deal. More recently, he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking amid a flood of new allegations.

Minsky, who died in 2016, was known as an associate of Epstein, but this is the first direct accusation implicating the AI pioneer in Epstein’s broader sex trafficking network. The deposition also names Prince Andrew of Britain and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among others.

The accusation against Minsky was made by Virginia Giuffre, who was deposed in May 2016 as part of a broader defamation suit between her and an Epstein associate named Ghislaine Maxwell. In the deposition, Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky when he visited Epstein’s compound in the US Virgin Islands.

As part of the defamation suit, Maxwell’s counsel denied the allegations, calling them “salacious and improper.” Representatives for Giuffre and Maxwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A separate witness lent credence to Giuffre’s account, testifying that she and Minsky had taken a private plane from Teterboro to Santa Fe and Palm Beach in March 2001. Epstein, Maxwell, chef Adam Perry Lang, and shipping heir Henry Jarecki were also passengers on the flight, according to the deposition. At the time of the flight, Giuffre was 17; Minsky was 73.

A pivotal member of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, Marvin Minsky pioneered the first generation of self-training algorithms, establishing the concept of artificial neural networks in his 1969 book Perceptrons. He also developed the first head-mounted display, a precursor to modern VR and augmented reality systems.

Minsky was one of a number of prominent scientists with ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who often called himself a “science philanthropist” and donated to research projects and academic institutions. Many of those scientists were affiliated with Harvard, including physicist Lawrence Krauss, geneticist George Church, and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker. Minsky’s affiliation with Epstein went particularly deep, including organizing a two-day symposium on artificial intelligence at Epstein’s private island in 2002, as reported by Slate. In 2012, the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation issued a press release touting another conference organized by Minsky on the island in December 2011.

That private island is alleged to have been the site of an immense sex trafficking ring. But Epstein associates have argued that those crimes were not apparent to Epstein’s social relations, despite the presence of young women at many of his gatherings.

“These people were seen not only by me,” Alan Dershowitz argued in a 2015 deposition. “They were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by \[George\] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world.”

“There was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people,” Dershowitz continued.

mdldtt,MachineLearning,1616753332.0,"Behind paywall:

With new machine-learning models coming online daily, the company created a new system to track their impact and maximize user engagement. The process is still the same today. Teams train up a new machine-learning model on FBLearner, whether to change the ranking order of posts or to better catch content that violates Facebook’s community standards (its rules on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform). Then they test the new model on a small subset of Facebook’s users to measure how it changes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares, says Krishna Gade, who served as the engineering manager for news feed from 2016 to 2018.

If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored. On Twitter, Gade explained that his engineers would get notifications every few days when metrics such as likes or comments were down. Then they’d decipher what had caused the problem and whether any models needed retraining.

But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff. Sometimes this inflames existing political tensions. The most devastating example to date is the case of Myanmar, where viral fake news and hate speech about the Rohingya Muslim minority escalated the country’s religious conflict into a full-blown genocide. Facebook admitted in 2018, after years of downplaying its role, that it had not done enough “to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.”

While Facebook may have been oblivious to these consequences in the beginning, it was studying them by 2016. In an internal presentation from that year, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, a company researcher, Monica Lee, found that Facebook was not only hosting a large number of extremist groups but also promoting them to its users: “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,” the presentation said, predominantly thanks to the models behind the “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” features.

h96nz8,datascience,1592186086.0,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

edgai0,datascience,1576877006.0,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edgai0/advice_for_those_entering_the_workforce_your_job/,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,,621,91,0.95

These algorithms are trained to maximize profit by influencing people's attention, information streams and priority queues. I think its truly a shame that working for Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc is seen as ""the holy grail"" as an ML engineer/ researcher.  The best paid (and therefore probably some of the most skilled) people in our field are working on thát. Not medicine, not science.. no, they work on recommender algorithms that act as catalysts for the worst in humanity, in turn for more ad revenue.

7htg5f,MachineLearning,1512513432.0,"Hey there,

Let's get straight to the point : yesterday, NVIDIA released an open source[ pytorch implementation of flownet2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch), which released a CUDA version of the correlation layer introduced by the paper [FlowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852). It turns out out that this code is protected by NVIDIA copyright while it heavily reuse parts of a code I wrote myslef 6 months ago : [FlowNet Pytorch](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch)

My goal is not to rant or to fulfil my self esteem, but to figure what to do in the most pragmatic manner in order to take the best of both worlds and make the best implementation possible.

That's not the most important part, but as a proof, here are some comparisons you can make :

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/607f99f46be3eccbd9b07c73848a68bc12156392/multiscaleloss.py#L8) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46)

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L9) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/submodules.py#L7)

Now as a disclaimer, I am very honoured they decided to use my code, and it is very obvious that my code is not rocket science and the main contribution of this project is not these little snippets but rather the custom layers and the pretrained weights for pytorch.

However, the fact that the README is not giving any credit for what I did feels a little uncool, especially with a [License file](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE) saying that all copyright goes to NVIDIA.

My other concern is that the parts of the code that got copied were actually not very well written, and the implementation in my own repo is to my mind much better now (for example [`MulstiScaleLoss`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46) module is a nightmare to read and to use while pytorch gives tools for making it [much more readable](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/master/multiscaleloss.py#L15)). I could make several Pull Requests but it's not garanteed to be merged rapidly and I'd prefer to contact the author first to get things straight and make them know that all I want is the best flownet2 implementation, and as this project is already gaining a lot of stars, it would be pointless to do my own fork ^with ^blackjack ^and ^hookers

My huge mistake was maybe to not have put a License in my code in the first place, but apparently, [a default one still holds](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license).

So what would be the best to do to get to work constructively with the project authors to improve their implementation and maybe also get a little credit for the code on which they built this project ? (also, is my claim reasonable ?)

Thanks in advance for your help !

> We recently benchmarked against a set of Python functions that have good test coverage in open source repos. We blanked out the function bodies and asked GitHub Copilot to fill them in. The model got this right 43% of the time on the first try, and 57% of the time when allowed 10 attempts. And it’s getting smarter all the time.

The service is based on OpenAI's Codex model, which has not been released yet but [Greg Brockman (OpenAI CTO) tweeted that it will be made available through their API later this summer](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1409890354132750336?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/oaambv/n_github_and_openai_release_copilot_an_ai_pair/,[N] GitHub and OpenAI release Copilot: an AI pair programmer,News,618,82,0.98
lbr6qi,MachineLearning,1612369170.0,"Hi all, we’ve launched an index of over 3,000 ML datasets. It’s our first step to make research datasets more discoverable. With the new feature you can:

* browse datasets by task (f.e., [Question Answering](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=question-answering), [Semantic Segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=semantic-segmentation)), modality (f.e., [Videos](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?mod=videos), [3D](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?mod=3d)) or language (f.e., [English](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?lang=english), [Chinese](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?lang=chinese), [German](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?lang=german), [French](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?lang=french)),
* keep track of the newest datasets in your area of interests (f.e., [Visual Question Answering](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?o=newest&task=visual-question-answering), [Autonomous Driving](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?o=newest&task=autonomous-driving)),
* browse benchmarks evaluating on a particular dataset,
* discover similar datasets,
* view usage over time in open-access research papers.

We focus on datasets introduced in ML papers.

This is an open resource so you can edit and add new datasets. We welcome suggestions, comments and feedback.

I am not the developer of The Big Sleep. [This](https://twitter.com/advadnoun/) is the developer's Twitter account; [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/advadnoun) is the developer's Reddit account.

**Steps to follow to generate the first image in a given Google Colab session**:

1. Optionally, if this is your first time using Google Colab, view this [Colab introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and/or this [Colab FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).
2. Click [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing).
3. Sign into your Google account if you're not already signed in. Click the ""S"" button in the upper right to do this. Note: Being signed into a Google account has privacy ramifications, such as your Google search history being recorded in your Google account.
4. In the Table of Contents, click ""Parameters"".
5. Find the line that reads ""tx = clip.tokenize('''a cityscape in the style of Van Gogh''')"" and change the text inside of the single quote marks to your desired text; example: ""tx = clip.tokenize('''a photo of New York City''')"". The developer recommends that you keep the three single quote marks on both ends of your desired text so that mult-line text can be used  An alternative is to remove two of the single quotes on each end of your desired text; example: ""tx = clip.tokenize('a photo of New York City')"".
6. In the Table of Contents, click ""Restart the kernel..."".
7. Position the pointer over the first cell in the notebook, which starts with text ""import subprocess"". Click the play button (the triangle) to run the cell. Wait until the cell completes execution.
8. Click menu item ""Runtime->Restart and run all"".
9. In the Table of Contents, click ""Diagnostics"". The output appears near the end of the Train cell that immediately precedes the Diagnostics cell, so scroll up a bit. Every few minutes (or perhaps 10 minutes if Google assigned you relatively slow hardware for this session), a new image will appear in the Train cell that is a refinement of the previous image. This process can go on for as long as you want until Google ends your Google Colab session, which is a total of [up to 12 hours](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) for the free version of Google Colab.

**Steps to follow if you want to start a different run using the same Google Colab session:**

1. Click menu item ""Runtime->Interrupt execution"".
2. Save any images that you want to keep by right-clicking on them and using the appropriate context menu command.
3. Optionally, change the desired text. Different runs using the same desired text almost always results in different outputs.
4. Click menu item ""Runtime->Restart and run all"".

**Steps to follow when you're done with your Google Colab session**:

1. Click menu item ""Runtime->Manage sessions"". Click ""Terminate"" to end the session.
2. Optionally, log out of your Google account due to the privacy ramifications of being logged into a Google account.

The first output image in the Train cell (using the notebook's default of seeing every 100th image generated) usually is a very poor match to the desired text, but the second output image often is a decent match to the desired text. To change the default of seeing every 100th image generated, change the number 100 in line ""if itt % 100 == 0:"" in the Train cell to the desired number. **For free-tier Google Colab users, I recommend changing 100 to a small integer such as 5.**

Tips for the text descriptions that you supply:

1. In Section 3.1.4 of OpenAI's [CLIP paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) (pdf), the authors recommend using a text description of the form ""A photo of a {label}."" or ""A photo of a {label}, a type of {type}."" for images that are photographs.
2. A Reddit user gives [these tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l2hmqn/this_aint_it_chief/gk8g8e9/).
3. The Big Sleep should generate [these 1,000 types of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l7hbix/tip_for_users_of_the_big_sleep_it_should_on/) better on average than other types of things.

[Here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/big-sleep-ai-image-generator/) is an article containing a high-level description of how The Big Sleep works. The Big Sleep uses a modified version of [BigGAN](https://aiweirdness.com/post/182322518157/welcome-to-latent-space) as its image generator component. The Big Sleep uses the ViT-B/32 [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) model to rate how well a given image matches your desired text. The best CLIP model according to the CLIP paper authors is the (as of this writing) unreleased ViT-L/14-336px model; see Table 10 on page 40 of the [CLIP paper (pdf)](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) for a comparison.

There are [many other sites/programs/projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ldc6oc/p_list_of_sitesprogramsprojects_that_use_openais/) that use CLIP to steer image/video creation to match a text description.

Some relevant subreddits:

2. [r/deepdream](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepdream/) (subreddit for images/videos generated from machine learning algorithms).

Why? Well, facebook forces us to use quite specific representation of emotions to react to things. In a way, these emojis become our facial expression. So it would only fair to apply the same expression to Zuckerberg's face.

vtzw0b,datascience,1657247524.0,"More often than not, I see comments on this thread suggesting the dilution of the Data Science discipline into a glorified Data Analyst position. Maybe my 10 years in the Data Science field leads me to possessing a level of naivety, but I’ve concluded that Data Science in its academic interpretation is far from its practicality in application. 

Take for example the rise of VC funding of startups and compare the ROI/success rate of AI-specific startups versus non-AI centric companies. Most AI startups in the past 5 years have failed. Why is this? Overwhelmingly, there is over promise of results with underperformance in value. That simply cannot be blamed on faulty hiring managers. 

Now shift to large market cap institutions. AI and Machine Learning provide value added in specific situations, but not with the prevalence that would support the volume of Data Science positions advertising classic AI/ML…the infrastructure simply doesn’t exist. Instead, entry level Data Scientists enter the workforce expecting relatively clean datasets/sources with proper governance and pedigree when reality slaps them in the face after finding out Fred down the hall has 5 terabytes in a set of disparate hard drives under his desk. (Obviously this is hyperbole but I wouldn’t put it past some users here saying ‘oh shit how do you know Fred?!’) 

These early career individuals who become underwhelmed with industry are not to blame either. Academic institutions have raced ass first toward the cash cow of offering Data Scientist majors and certificates. Such courses are often taught by many professors whose last time in a for-profit firm was during the days where COBAL was a preferred language of choice.  Sure most can reach the topics of AI/ML but can they teach its application in an industry ill-prepared for it?

This leads me to my final word of advice for whomever is seeking it. Regardless of your title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc), find value in providing value. If you spend 5 months converting a 97.8% accurate model into 99.99% accuracy and net $10K in savings but the intern down the hall netted $10M in savings by simply running a simple regression model after digging into Fred’s desk, who provided more value added?

Those who provide value will be paid the magnitude their contribution necessitates. 

Anyways, be great.

I'm not a machine learning guy (perhaps one day!), but it was suggested to me that some of you may want a crack at this data.

Using JHU's time\_series\_19-covid-Confirmed.csv csv format, and going back to 1/1/20, using Dark Sky's API, I went and grabbed the following pieces of data for each day for each site:

* Cloud cover
* Dew point
* Relative humidity
* Ozone
* Precipitation probability
* Air pressure
* Sunrise time
* Sunset time
* Max temperature
* Min temperature
* UV index
* Wind speed

These are all recorded as CSV files in the /csv folder.

If any of you want to use this to take a crack at trying to figure out if any of these factors play into the spread of the virus, by all means, please do so. You can correlate my values with JHU's numbers in terms of rate of spread and all that from their repository that I branched off of. The big caveat here is that I'm just a guy, and none of my data have been audited or validated or anything, but at least it's something, I guess.

dn6xrr,MachineLearning,1572052193.0,"Understanding searches better than ever before

If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the 15 years working on Google Search, it’s that people’s curiosity is endless. We see billions of searches every day, and 15 percent of those queries are ones we haven’t seen before--so we’ve built ways to return results for queries we can’t anticipate.

When people like you or I come to Search, we aren’t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. We might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to Search looking to learn--we don’t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with. 

At its core, Search is about understanding language. It’s our job to figure out what you’re searching for and surface helpful information from the web, no matter how you spell or combine the words in your query. While we’ve continued to improve our language understanding capabilities over the years, we sometimes still don’t quite get it right, particularly with complex or conversational queries. In fact, that’s one of the reasons why people often use “keyword-ese,” typing strings of words that they think we’ll understand, but aren’t actually how they’d naturally ask a question. 

With the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we’re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search. 

**Applying BERT models to Search**  
Last year, we [introduced and open-sourced](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or as we call it--[BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), for short. This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. 

This breakthrough was the result of Google research on [transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html): models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.

But it’s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. Some of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we’re using the latest [Cloud TPUs ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records)to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly. 

**Cracking your queries**  
So that’s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? Well, by applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we’re able to do a much better job  helping you find useful information. In fact, when it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English, and we’ll bring this to more languages and locales over time.

Particularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like “for” and “to” matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. You can search in a way that feels natural for you.

To launch these improvements, we did a lot of [testing](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/) to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. Here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate BERT’s ability to understand the intent behind your search.  


Here’s a search for “2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.” The word “to” and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. It’s about a Brazilian traveling to the U.S., and not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query.

Let’s look at another query: “do estheticians stand a lot at work.” Previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term “stand-alone” in the result with the word “stand” in the query. But that isn’t the right use of the word “stand” in context. Our BERT models, on the other hand, understand that “stand” is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response.

Here are some other examples where BERT has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don’t quite understand the way humans do.

**Improving Search in more languages**  
We’re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world. A powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. So we can take models that learn from improvements in English (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. This helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that Search is offered in.

For featured snippets, we’re using a BERT model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like Korean, Hindi and Portuguese.

**Search is not a solved problem**  
No matter what you’re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you’re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. But you’ll still stump Google from time to time. Even with BERT, we don’t always get it right. If you search for “what state is south of Nebraska,” BERT’s best guess is a community called “South Nebraska.” (If you've got a feeling it's not in Kansas, you're right.)

Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve Search. We’re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way.

Keep in mind that the folks who post on these forums are not a representative sample. It naturally skews towards people who are drawn to high compensation / level / ""prestige""

Even sources like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) only show the compensations of people who choose to share it, which again isn't a representative sample. If compensation / level / prestige is what you're after, by all means, go for it and work for it. But comparing yourself to people who  *humble brag* on social media does nothing good for your mental health.

Also keep in mind that on average \~65,000 CS graduates graduate every year in the US.

Of these, only about 10% (just napkin math based on number of employees in Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and assuming only \~50% of them are ""tech"" roles) can ever work in Big N, and of the 10% there, only about another 10% make it to Staff levels, which is where you see compensations of 500k+ (some seniors can make it too, but it's more reliably available at staff+ levels). And these salaries too are only common in SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and maybe Austin.

I learned about it through his [inaugural tweet](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI) on their [miraculous year](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html). I knew LSTM, but I did not know that he and Sepp Hochreiter did all those other things 30 years ago. 

The blog sums it up in section 5 Artificial Curiosity Through Adversarial Generative Neural Networks (1990)

> The first NN is called the controller C. C (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. The second NN is called the world model M. It predicts the environmental reactions to C's outputs. Using gradient descent, M minimises its error, thus becoming a better predictor. But in a zero sum game, C tries to find outputs that maximise the error of M. M's loss is the gain of C.  

> That is, C is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that M still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. Compare more recent summaries and extensions of this principle, e.g., [AC09]. 

> GANs are an application of Adversarial Curiosity [AC90] where the environment simply returns whether C's current output is in a given set [AC19].

So I read those referenced papers. [AC19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493) is kinda modern guide to the old report [AC90](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf) where the adversarial part first appeared in section: Implementing Dynamic Curiosity and Boredom, and the generative part in section: Explicit Random Actions versus Imported Randomness, which is like GANs versus conditional GANs. [AC09](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/multipleways2009.pdf) is a survey from 2009 and sums it up: maximise reward for prediction error.

I know that Ian Goodfellow says he is the inventor of GANs, but he must have been a little boy when Jurgen did this in 1990. Also funny that Yann LeCun described GANs as ""the coolest idea in machine learning in the last twenty years"" although Jurgen had it thirty years ago

Today Google put out a paper (MLP-Mixer) that proposes exactly the same architecture.

For those who are interested, here's a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention) with pretrained models, a [W&B log](https://wandb.ai/lukemelas2/deit-experiments/reports/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention---Vmlldzo2NjUxMzI?accessToken=8kebvweue0gd1s6qiav2orco97v85glogsi8i83576j42bb1g39e59px56lkk4zu) of the experiments, and a 3-page [writeup](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention/blob/main/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention.pdf).

Also, if anyone has stories about getting scooped, feel free to share -- I'd imagine people have some crazy stories.

My (non-finance) company is currently hiring for a role and over 20% of the resumes we've received have a stock market project with a claim of being over 95% accurate at predicting the price of a given stock. On looking at the GitHub code for the projects, every single one of these projects has not accounted for look-ahead bias and simply train/test split 80/20 - allowing the model to train on future data. A majority of theses resumes have references to MOOCs, FreeCodeCamp being a frequent one. 

I don't know if this stock market project is a MOOC module somewhere, but it's a really bad one and we've rejected all the resumes that have it since time-series modelling is critical to what we do.

hrawam,MachineLearning,1594763635.0,"EDIT:

Someone replied to the issue, this is what was said:

>It looks like what's going on is:
The layers currently enter a 'functional api construction' mode only if all of the inputs in the first argument come from other Keras layers. However, you have None included in the inputs in the first positional arg, so it's not triggering functional api construction.

>That causes the layer to get 'inlined' in the outer functional model rather than correctly included. You should be able to work around this by changing the layer api so Nones should not get passed in.

>We have a major cleanup/refactoring of the Functional API mostly done that make the functional api triggering much clearer (if any symbolic values appear in the inputs) & sort out a number of other issues w/ it. But, that will only land in 2.4. It's not immediately obvious if we can squeeze a fix into tf 2.3 as the RC is already out.

If you look at the notebooks, the inputs to some of the lines look like this:

`    P_outputs = P_trans11((inputHiddenVals, None, None, None))[0]`

It looks like the issue is that the  are extra `None`s are causing disappearing variables issue, and a workaround could be just to have 

`    P_outputs = P_trans11(inputHiddenVals)[0]`




----

tl'dr: For anyone who has used the functional api with custom layers, it might be worth running


    for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):
        print(model.trainable_variables[i].name)
    

so see if all your weights are there. 

----

Using custom layers with the functional API results in missing weights in the `trainable_variables`. Those weights are not in the `non_trainable_variables` either. 

But if those weights aren't in `trainable_variables`they are essential frozen, since it is only those weights that receive gradient updates, as seen in the Keras model training code below:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1fb8f4988d69237879aac4d9e3f268f837dc0221/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L2729

      if aggregate_grads_outside_optimizer:
        # We aggregate gradients before unscaling them, in case a subclass of
        # LossScaleOptimizer all-reduces in fp16. All-reducing in fp16 can only be
        # done on scaled gradients, not unscaled gradients, for numeric stability.
        gradients = optimizer._aggregate_gradients(zip(gradients,  # pylint: disable=protected-access

              experimental_aggregate_gradients=False)
        else:
          optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_variables))



The bug can be seen in this Colab gist 

https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Santosh-Gupta/40c54e5b76e3f522fa78da6a248b6826/missingtrainablevarsinference_var.ipynb

This gist uses the transformers library to create the models so its easy to see the bug. For an in-depth look, the colab gist below creates all the custom layers from scratch

https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Santosh-Gupta/aa34086a72956600910976e4f7ebe323/model_weight_debug_scratch_public_inference_var.ipynb


As you can see in the notebooks, a workaround is to create models using keras subclassing instead; model subclassing results in all the weights appearing in `trainable_variables`. To be absolutely sure that the functional API and subclasses models are exactly the same, I ran inference on them using the same input at the bottom of each notebook; the outputs for the models were exactly the same. But training using the functional API model would treat many of the weights as frozen (and there's no way to make them unfrozen since those weights aren't registered in the `non_trainable_variables` either). 

I've been looking at this for about a month, as far as I can tell, I don't think there was anything unique about the transformer layer I created; it may be the case that Any Keras model using custom sublayers and the functional API is prone to this. 

I put up a Github issue 24 days ago, but I can't tell if this is something being worked on.

Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.

## 10 tips:

1.	**Be helpful, don’t be obedient**. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.
2.	**Small talk is not a waste of time**; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.
3.	**Adjust your message to the audience.** Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).
4.	**A good presentation is like a good conversation**. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.
5.	**If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction.** Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?
6.	**Nobody likes surprises**. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.
7.	**Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea**. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.
8.	**The client is not your friend**. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.
9.	The more senior your audience is, **the more to the point you need to be**.
10. Being professional is not about removing emotion. **It is OK to smile** :).

<rant>  


I recently applied to several top PhD programs, and so far I've been rejected from Berkeley, University of Washington, Columbia, Stanford, and MIT. I am expecting that I'll be rejected from the remaining programs soon. I didn't even get an interview chance, I was just rejected without speaking to anyone.

I'll start with my profile (which I am willing to verify on a zoom call if any mod requests it). I grew up in a poor city in a third world country, to a very poor family. I managed to work hard during high school, ranking 3rd in my country in national exams, and got accepted on a full ride scholarship to a Hong Kong university. I have a GPA of 3.9+. I have a first author NeurIPS paper that was completed without any faculty advisors (Me and another undergraduate wrote the paper independently and it got accepted). I also have a paper in an A\* information theory conference where we settled an open problem that has been open for 8 years. I have two submissions in TCS and IEEE Transactions on information theory (both A\* journals), and one has already received a minor revision (on its way to be accepted). During my undergrad, my mother got breast cancer, and I had to work two part time jobs just to help with paying for the medical bills, while keeping up with my studies and my research. I remember I slept an average of 5 hours per day in the months of treatment. I have seen two of my LORs, both professors mentioned that I am the best undergraduate who has worked with them in their lifetime as Professors.

I feel tired, mentally exhausted, and crushed. I've worked so hard over the last 8 years, just to have all my dreams destroyed. It doesn't help when everyone around me keeps saying I am ""a shoo-in for Stanford"". I just feel like I've been fighting an uphill fight all my life with no guidance, constantly having to work harder just to prove myself, and in the end, it still didn't work. I just don't understand what these top programs are looking for. I heard some programs like UWashington even interviewed the top 20% of applicants, which means I'm not even close.

I'm of those (rare??) persons who does ML for a living but has no interest in doing it. I've built models using classical and deep learning approaches for 7-8 years, and a lot of them had decent impacts in the companies I've worked with. I'm good at what I do and I'm compensated well for it. However, nothing in the field of ML/DL excites me anymore.

I find it more enjoyable to solve problems in my math textbooks . In fact, I want a career in which I can do some form of mathematics but I don't want to do machine learning for the rest of my life. Before I shifted to ML for the money, I worked a lot on satellite systems engineering. I also took a lot of physics and EE courses during my masters degree (optics, quantum mechanics and solid state devices).

I was thinking of a career in quantum information but I don't have a PhD yet. Also, my computer science skills aren't strong enough to switch to cryptography. Any thoughts / ideas on how to get out of machine learning?

UPDATE: 2nd March, 2022 \[1\]- Thanks a lot everyone for your answers/comments. I'm overwhelmed and humbled by your responses. I'll reply to each one of you during this week or the next, whenever I find some time. I'm caught up in something personal.

\[2\] I came across this course recently - [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838\_spring\_2021.html](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838_spring_2021.html). This one looks super exciting. Here's a course on discrete differential geometry that I found online -  [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/). I'd love to explore differential geometry applied to ML problems (or vice versa).

\[3\]  I would prefer to work on ML in fields like applied physics or genetics rather than banking, social media analytics or consumer electronics.

\[4\] (This is a short rant)-  I'm sick of technical papers that have titles like ""X is all you need"" or ""Your classifier is secretly an energy based model and you should treat it like one"". I have nothing against anyone here and I'm absolutely certain that the authors are 100000x more knowledgable than I am but I'm very uncomfortable with such pompous paper titles. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't seen catchy titles in physics or mathematics. This is one (trivial) reason why I don't want to pursue a PhD in ML. I hate the grandeur and style!!

\[5\] Rant 2- Taking any online course from any platform does NOT make you a data scientist or an ML researcher. I hate the fact that not many of them are not willing to put in the time/effort to learn the fundamental math behind ML algorithms. When I ask someone in an interview to explain what PCA is, they stop with the answer that PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. No word about eigenvalues/eigenvectors or covariance matrix. :(

I trained every single SOTA model from 2021 and accidentally got a silver medal on an image classification competition on Kaggle recently (Pawpularity Contest). 

> [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/the-nuclear-option-train) If you are interested

The idea was to train every SOTA and then **Nuke the leaderboard with 10 Billion parameters** ensemble of ensembles. 
Some ensembles were also supplemented a bit with catboost 2nd stage model just for the ""why not"". 

**Outline of the approach: https://i.ibb.co/McJ39mW/image-nuke.png**

This stunt was done mainly for the purpose me catching up with the current most recent SOTA vision papers. 

I seriously didn't try to compete on the leaderboard and never had the intention of releasing a public notebook that actually gets a silver medal. 
This came as a complete surprise to me! 
Hope the solution will be useful for many others in the future.

In real-life projects, datasets are rarely static. They grow, change, and evolve over time. But this fact is not reflected in how most datasets are maintained. Taking inspiration from software dev, where codebases are managed using Git, we can create living Git repositories for our datasets as well.

This means the dataset becomes easily manageable, and sharing, collaborating, and updating downstream consumers of changes to the data can be done similar to how we manage PIP or NPM packages.

I wrote a blog about such a project, showcasing how to transform a dataset into a *living-dataset,* and use it in a machine learning project.

One of Google’s top A.I. people just joined Apple

- Ian Goodfellow joined Apple’s Special Projects Group as a director of machine learning last month.

- Prior to Google, he worked at OpenAI, an AI research consortium originally funded by Elon Musk and other tech notables.

- He is the father of an AI approach known as general adversarial networks, or GANs, and his research is widely cited in AI literature.

Ian Goodfellow, one of the top minds in artificial intelligence at Google, has joined Apple in a director role.

The hire comes as Apple increasingly strives to tap AI to boost its software and hardware. Last year Apple hired John Giannandrea, head of AI and search at Google, to supervise AI strategy.


Goodfellow updated his LinkedIn profile on Thursday to acknowledge that he moved from Google to Apple in March. He said he’s a director of machine learning in the Special Projects Group. In addition to developing AI for features like FaceID and Siri, Apple also has been working on autonomous driving technology. Recently the autonomous group had a round of layoffs.

A Google spokesperson confirmed his departure. Apple declined to comment. Goodfellow didn’t respond to a request for comment.

I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.

I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last year required me to learn this language.

Since then, I moved to a different lab and the folks there really wanted me to use R to develop the code for data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, regression analyses, etc..., since it is the most commonly used language in this field (Enviro. Chem).

While I was initially resistant at first to learn R, once I got the hang of it, it really started to feel like magic to me. What took me maybe 3 to 5 lines of code in python to perform a task (granted, I am not the best coder) is a simple function in R. Somehow, it all just intuitively makes sense to me.

I don't know; I don't find R getting much love out there (at least in my learning experience of data science), and just wanted to make a post about it. I aim to get much better in this language (and also python too), simply because I find this to be a very powerful language.

I guess that concludes my love letter to R.

Here I have made efforts to derive GNNs from first principles, motivate their use across the sciences, and explain how they emerged, in parallel, along several research lines. This represents a 'convergence' of the \~4 years I've spent studying GNNs: I taught them in many ways over the years, and I feel like I have finally found, imho, the most 'natural' way to introduce them.

*(For the amazing insights in this direction, I need to give a shout-out to my ongoing collaborators: Joan Bruna, Michael Bronstein and Taco Cohen!)*

The live Zoom session attracted \~500 people, and I received many emails afterwards in support of the talk -- hence I believe it could be both of use to beginners in the area, and offer a new perspective to seasoned GNN practitioners.

I also aded a BERT model to try to predict which comment would get the most upvotes.

Several people replied to the output replies as if it was a real person so I think it probably passes a light Turing sniff test (maybe they were bots too, who knows?).  Hopefully nobody gets too mad that I tested the model in the wild. I ran it sparingly and made sure it wasn't saying anything inflammatory.

User u/panties_in_my_ass got many upvotes for this comment: 

>Spectrum: What's the key to that kind of adaptability?***  
>  
>Bengio: [Meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03030.pdf) is a very hot topic these days: Learning to learn.

>  
>Somewhere, on some laptop, Schmidhuber is screaming at his monitor right now.

because he introduced meta-learning 4 years before Bengio: 

Jürgen Schmidhuber. Evolutionary principles in self-referential learning, or on learning how to learn: The meta-meta-... hook. Diploma thesis, Tech Univ. Munich, 1987.

Then Bengio gave his [NeurIPS 2019 talk](https://slideslive.com/38921750/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning). Slide 71 says:

>Meta-learning or learning to learn (Bengio et al 1991; Schmidhuber 1992)

u/y0hun commented:

>What a childish slight... The Schmidhuber 1987 paper is clearly labeled and established and as a nasty slight he juxtaposes his paper against Schmidhuber with his preceding it by a year almost doing the opposite of giving him credit.

I detect a broader pattern here. Look at this highly upvoted post: [Jürgen Schmidhuber really had GANs in 1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/djju8a/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_really_had_gans_in_1990/), 25 years before Bengio. u/siddarth2947 commented that

>GANs were actually mentioned in the Turing laudation, it's both funny and sad that Yoshua Bengio got a Turing award for a principle that Jurgen invented decades before him

and that section 3 of Schmidhuber's [post on their miraculous year 1990-1991](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html) is actually about his former student Sepp Hochreiter and Bengio:

> (In 1994, others published results [VAN2] essentially identical to the 1991 vanishing gradient results of Sepp [VAN1]. Even after a common publication [VAN3], the first author of reference [VAN2] published papers (e.g., [VAN4]) that cited only his own 1994 paper but not Sepp's original work.)

So Bengio republished at least 3 important ideas from Schmidhuber's lab without giving credit: meta-learning, vanishing gradients, GANs.

As an example, I had just finished fully reading/comprehending a paper, and I won’t lie, took me a solid couple days to understand everything fully and reading things multiple times. 

Meanwhile, in the daily meetings we have I mention the paper and how we should try and use some of their components in our own work, and someone says, “oh ya, I read that in like 15 mins”. So we decide to have an impromptu discussion on it and Jesus Christ, I swear the only thing he read was the abstract and maybe glanced at the network architecture.

Hi Reddit,

I'm excited to share with you our latest work, [\[2203.03466\] Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466).

Code: [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAghCYx)

  


https://preview.redd.it/nnb2usdjlkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=904ab26ae60b4a3fd3c1428ac5fd7d0d7e54bf94

(Disclaimer: this post is shamelessly converted from my twitter thread)

The idea is actually really simple: in a special parametrization introduced in [our previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522) ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/)) called µP, narrow and wide neural networks share the same set of optimal hyperparameters. This works even as width -> ∞.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dqna8guklkm81.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5791e6ba46d7d065046913a7f93c5b2acde5e90f

The hyperparameters can include learning rate, learning rate schedule, initialization, parameter multipliers, and more, even individually for each parameter tensor. We empirically verified this on Transformers up to width 4096.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rwdsb6snlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0faac2112c556879992bda093f22eb0cb91dc356

Using this insight, we can just tune a tiny version of GPT-3 on a single GPU --- if the hyperparameters we get on the small model is near optimal, then they should also be near optimal on the large model! We call this way of tuning \*µTransfer\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mi7ibyyolkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24bfbb234658d25d534cab1a2f2219f45b2e63a3

We µTransferred hyperparameters from a small 40 million parameter version of GPT-3 — small enough to fit on a single GPU — to the 6.7 billion version. With some asterisks, we get a performance comparable to the original GPT-3 model with twice the parameter count!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rrq2yfwplkm81.png?width=3232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=519cf2adcbec60a611917d6126964b22f1fb1c2b

The total tuning cost is only 7% of the whole pretrain compute cost! Since the direct tuning of the small model costs roughly the same even as the large model increases in size, tuning the 175B GPT-3 this way would probably cost at most 0.3% of the total pretrain compute.

You: ""wait can I shrink the model only in width?""

Bad news: there's not much theoretical guarantee for non-width stuff

good news: we empirically tested transfer across depth, batch size, sequence length, & timestep work within reasonable ranges on preLN transformers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x7fo95yqlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a967beb7b6b2777c07216642bf9a7eb91faa3898

We applied this to tune BERT-base and BERT-large simultaneously by shrinking them to the same small model in both width and depth, where we did the direct tuning. We got a really nice improvement over the already well-tuned megatron BERT baseline, especially for BERT-large!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/db5eausrlkm81.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c01676ad433167898c49f62f6c7a8862f3e1f4c4

In general, it seems that the larger a model is, the less well tuned it is --- which totally makes sense --- and thus the more to gain from µTransfer. We didn't have compute to retrain the GPT-3 175B model, but I'll leave your mouth watering with that thought.

OK, so what actually is µP and how do you implement it?

It's encapsulated by the following table for how to scale your initialization and learning rate with fan-in or fan-out. The purple text is µP and the gray text in parenthesis is pytorch default, for reference, and the black text is shared by both.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4475drzvlkm81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1de7bf7c52dff80973eaf61dcd5d8fa487f46d7

But just like you don't typically want to implement autograd by hand even though autograd is just chain rule, we recommend using our package [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAg026Z) to implement µP in your models.

The really curious ones of you: ""OK what is the theoretical motivation behind all this?""

Unfortunately, this is already getting long, so feel free to check out the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/) on [our previous theoretical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522), and people let me know if this is something you want to hear for another time!

But I have to say that this is a rare occasion in deep learning where very serious mathematics has concretely delivered a result previously unthinkable, and I'm elated with how things turned out! In contrast to [this reddit thread a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/t8fn7m/d_are_we_at_the_end_of_an_era_where_ml_could_be/), I think there are plenty of room for new, fundamental mathematics to change the direction of deep learning and artificial intelligence in general --- why chase the coattail of empirical research trying to ""explain"" them all when you can lead the field with deep theoretical insights?

> I am currently a software engineer in a data science team producing software that yields millions of dollars in revenue for our company. I did my undergraduate in physics and my professors encouraged us to view MIT Open Courseware lectures alongside their subpar teaching. I learned more from those online lectures than I ever could in those expensive classes. I paid tens of thousands of dollars for that education. I decided that it was better bang for my buck to learn data science than in would every be to continue on in the weak education system we have globally. I paid 30 dollars month, for a year, to pick up the skills to get into data science. I landed a great job, paying a great salary because I took advantage of these types of opportunities. If you hate on this guy for collecting code that is open to the public and creating huge value from it, then you can go get your masters degree for $50-100k and work for someone who took advantage of these types of offerings. Anyone who hates on this is part of an old school, suppressive system that will continue to hold talented people down. Buck the system and keep learning!

Earlier this month I had [a discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3zdibn/intelligent_agents_for_hearthstone/cylnbf2) over on /r/hearthstone with /u/yetipirate about Computer Go. Then the news hit this week of the first Go AI to beat a human professional.

We had some more discussion then, and I made a synopsis of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRHUHW6HQE), where the US Go Association has Myungwan Kim, 9-Dan Pro, analyse the games between the AlphaGo AI and human professional Fan Hui, 2-Dan Pro. (FTR: Professional go ranks start at 1-Dan and go up to 9-Dan, but rather than the absolute top 9-Dan is more like the beginning of grandmastery. The best players in the world are like 9-Dan+++++. Lee Sedol, which AlphaGo will challenge next this March, is at this latter level.)

/u/yetipirate suggested this synopsis might interest some people here as well, since it digests the salient points of a two hour video with lots of Go jargon into a more manageable post. So hence I'm posting it here, I hope you all enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions about Go, but I'm not that strong myself so ymmv. Anyway without further ado:

**In General:**

The match has been big news in East-Asia as well. The thing which most shocked all the professionals was that AlphaGo played so much like a human player. Their first impressions were that it's as if this was a human playing, not a computer.

Since how a human plays is, obviously, pretty well known, they decided that they'll focus commentary mostly on those cases where AlphaGo doesn't play like a human.

The first thing that Myungwan Kim noted was that AlphaGo has a Japanese playstyle (this is especially interesting because among the three traditional Go powerhouses, China, Korea, and Japan, the Japanese have been the weakest in international competitions for the past several decades). The commentators don't know, but they suspect it is that the original human data set was biased towards Japanese playstyles.

Myungwan Kim also makes a comment about one of the lines continually repeated in the coverage of Computer Go. The line that ""if you ask a top Go player why they like a certain move, they'll often say 'it felt right'"". Myungwan Kim wanted to add that just because it's based on intuition, doesn't mean there's no logic behind it at all. Top Go players aren't just guessing what are good moves, they have a real and complicated rational understanding about what specific moves are doing. Even if the final decision might come down to which move feels the best, it's not as simple as top pro's just doing a random move and saying 'I felt like it'.

**The Games:**

In the **first game** both sides played very passively in the opening. Leisurely and gentle they say.

Myungwan Kim finds that AlphaGo has a weakness here, it doesn't seem to understand the value of taking and holding initiative. Complicated to explain, but at its core it's about doing moves which force your opponent to use their turn to react to your move over doing moves which might be equally valuable to you, but leave your opponent free to do whatever they want on their turn.

Important, Myungwan Kim says because of this that the first game Fan Hui was winning in the opening. He says this was the only game Fan Hui was winning after the opening. He estimates Fan Hui was about 10 points ahead, and can't see white getting back even 5 points coming out of that opening. Myungwan Kim offers some alternate moves for AlphaGo which would still have Fan Hui in the lead, but would've given AlphaGo better opportunities to comeback.

Conclusion from the opening: AlphaGo lost because it didn't understand the value of initiative.

Myungwan Kim later points to one huge mistake by Fan Hui in the midgame that lost him the game. I can't go into detail here because, as characteristic of top-level Go, it's the difference of placing one stone one space higher. But Myungwan Kim says that while Fan Hui made other small mistakes, this one move is the big one which let AlphaGo come back from losing the opening.

Final conclusion from game one: Aside from not understanding initiative. Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo betrays itself as a computer in that it sometimes it goes too far in mimicking standard professional play and does the most common move instead of the most optimal move. In other words, it's extremely book smart, but at times fails to notice when it should be ignoring the books because the specific situation in the game makes the less standard move the most optimal one instead. (A bit cliche imo, but Myungwan Kim says ""AlphaGo is not creative"".) They think that might really hurt AlphaGo in the game against Lee Sedol.

**Game 2**, they note Fan Hui really played too aggressively, as he noted in his own post-match interview. Myungwan Kim says he can really see Fan Hui wasn't playing his best game, but was trying to test AlphaGo to see if it could be tricked into making exploitable mistakes.

Myungwan Kim says Fan Hui actually put up a really good fight. After the opening it should've been over for Fan Hui, but AlphaGo almost allowed Fan Hui to get back in the game.

**Game 3** is similar to the fifth game, though Fan Hui played better in the beginning here. Myungwan Kim notes several moves by AlphaGo which are top professional moves. He notes some moves by Fan Hui which he thinks hints that Fan Hui might be a bit out of practice when it comes to playing professional level games (he says it's the kind of move you do if too used to playing teaching games against amateurs). Fan Hui lost because he played over-aggressive and left too many holes in his defence as a result.

On the **fifth game**, Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo was winning from the beginning here. They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves here, but they're not sure whether AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or if it just got 'lucky' somehow.

Myungwan Kim points out AlphaGo made a huge mistake early in this game, but was saved because not long after Fan Hui made an equally huge mistake. But this is an example where he thinks a real grandmaster like Lee Sedol would not have allowed AlphaGo to get away with the kind of mistake it made there.

**AlphaGo's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's strengths:

 * It's not afraid of 'Ko'. 'Ko' is too complex a concept to explain succinctly, for an attempt [see my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/43fl90/synopsis_of_top_go_professionals_analysis_of/czi7swh). They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves surrounding a 'Ko' situation, but aren't sure if AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or just got lucky that it worked out.

 * Reading might be AlphaGo's strength. As in, cases where it comes down to very straightforward fights and moves it's very strong at choosing the right moves.

Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's weaknesses:

 * Doesn't understand initiative, as explained earlier.

 * At times too obsessed with following common patterns, when the specific situation might require creative deviation from those patterns. Also explained earlier.

 * It doesn't understand 'Aji'. 'Aji' is difficult to explain, but it refers to the amount of uncertainty remaining in a specific grouping of white and black stones. (Usually, it's about the chance that a group of stones which is 'death' might become alive and vice versa as a result of things happening elsewhere on the board.) You can also put this differently as: AlphaGo lacks proper long-term thinking.

 * Myungwan Kim thinks AlphaGo has difficulty, or even doesn't at all, evaluating the value of specific stones. It's good at making moves which directly gain territory for itself, but tends to miss moves which reduce the value of the opponent's stones.

 * It can make really high level moves at times, but it doesn't understand those moves. Which it displays by making the right moves at the wrong time.

More generally Myungwan Kim thinks a weakness of AlphaGo is its insularity. He really stresses that human pro's become much stronger when they discuss and analyse their games with other pro's. And because AlphaGo primarily plays against itself the quality of the feedback it gets on its play is too one-note, which leaves holes in its plays whereas human pro's getting feedback from many other human pro's end up with more robust and stronger playstyles. He really thinks to progress past its current level AlphaGo needs to play more with top human pro's rather than just itself. Right now, Myungwan Kim en most pro's he knows don't feel threatened by AlphaGo. They also talk about how AlphaGo can be useful for human pro's to study and become stronger, which can make AlphaGo stronger in turn. (This last paragraph is imo all just Myungwan Kim musing based on his understanding of how AlphaGo was designed more than evaluating its plays themselves, so that's why I didn't list it as a bullet point.)

In general, I get the sense from Myungwan Kim's explanations that he thinks AlphaGo is stronger at the more concrete parts of Go play, such as territory and life-or-death, and weaker at the more vague concepts, such as influence and uncertainty.

As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for, especially if you've made it to a conversational interview. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning or are you obviously chasing titles, prestige, or salary?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and an open-mind are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for.

I was surprised to hear that even Andrew Ng has trouble reading certain papers at times and he reaches out to other experts to get help, so I guess that it's something most of us will probably always have to deal with to some extent or another. 

If you're having trouble with a particular paper, post it with the parts you are having trouble with, and hopefully me or someone else may help out. It'll be like a mini study group to extract as much valuable info from each paper. 

Even if it's a paper that you're not per say totally stuck on, but it's just that it'll take a while to completely figure out, post it anyway in case you find some value in shaving off some precious time in pursuing the total comprehension of that paper, so that you can more quickly move onto other papers. 

Edit:

Okay we got some papers. I'm going through them one by one. Please have specific questions on where exactly you are stuck, even if it's a big picture issue. Just say something like 'what's the big picture'. 

Edit 2:

Gotta to do some irl stuff but will continue helping out tomorrow. Some of the papers are outside my proficiency so hopefully some other people on the subreddit can help out. 

Edit 3:

Okay this really blew up. Some papers it's taking a really long time to figure out. 

Another request I have in addition to specific question, type out any additional info/brief summary that can help cut down on the time it will take for someone to answer the question. For example, if there's an equation whose components are explained through out the paper, make a mini glossary of said equation. Try to aim so that perhaps the reader doesn't even need to read the paper (likely not possible but aiming for this will make for excellent summary info) and they can answer your question. 

What attempts have you made so far to figure out the question. 

Finally, what is your best guess to what you think the answer might be, and why. 

Edit 4:

More people should participate in the papers, not just people who can answer the questions. If any of the papers listed are of interest to you, can you read them, and reply to the comment with your own questions about the paper, so that someone can answer both your questions. It might turn out that he person who posted the paper knows the question, and it even might be the case that you stumbled upon the answers to the original questions. 

Think of each paper as an invite to an open study group for that paper, not just a queue for an expert to come along and answer it. 

Edit 5:

It looks like people want this to be a weekly feature here. I'm going to figure out the best format from the comments here and make a proposal to the mods. 

Edit 6: 

I'm still going through the papers and giving answers. Even if I can't answer the question I'll reply with something, but it'll take a while. But please provide as much summary info as I described in the last edits to help me navigate through the papers and quickly collect as much background info I need to answer the question.

uhirub,datascience,1651592109.0,"I'm working on picking up a machine learning pipeline that someone else has written. Here's a summary of what I'm dealing with:

* Pipeline is ~50 Python scripts, split across two computers. The pipeline requires bouncing back and forth between both computers (part GPU, part CPU; this can eventually be fixed). 
* There is no automation - each script was previously being invoked by individual commands.
* There is no organization. The script names are things like ""step_1_b_run_before"" ""step_1_preprocess_a"".
* There is no versioning, and there are different versions in multiple users' shared directories.
* The pipeline relies on about 60 dependencies, with no `requirements` files. Dependencies are split between pypi, conda, and individual githubs. Some dependencies need to be old versions (from 2016, for example).
* The scripts dump their output files in whatever directory they are run in, flooding the working directory with intermediate files and outputs.
* Some python scripts are run to generate bash files, which then need to be run to execute other python scripts. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine.
* Lots of commented out code; no comments or documentation
* The person who wrote this is a terrible coder. Anti-patterns galore, code smell (an understatement), copy/pasted segments, etc.
* There are no tests written. At some points, the pipeline errors out and/or generates empty files. I've managed to work around this by disabling certain parts of the pipeline.
* The person who wrote all this has left, and anyone who as run it previously does not really want to help
* I can't even begin to verify the accuracy of any of the results since I'm overwhelmed by simply trying to get it to run as intended

So the gist is that this company does not do code review of any sort, and the consequence is that some pipelines are pristine, and some do not function at all. My boss says ""don't spend too much time on it"" -- i.e. he seems to be telling me he wants results, but doesn't want to deal with the mountain of technical debt that has accrued in this project.

Anyway, I have NO idea what to do here. Obviously management doesn't care about maintainability in the slightest, but I just started this job and don't want to leave the wrong impression or go right back to the job market if I can avoid it.

Hi friends,

I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).


Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.


What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.


Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?


Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR & Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR & Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.


Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?


And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.


Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.


Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here.


I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.


So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.


Timnit

---------------------------------
Below is Jeff Dean's message sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning


Hi everyone,


I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.


Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.


Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.
A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper. 
Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.
Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don’t. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.


I know we all genuinely share Timnit’s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive. No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she’ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes.
Thank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do.

The current state of media coverage of AI is fixated on constructing a compelling narrative to readers, and often personifies models well beyond their capabilities.  This is to the extent that articles almost always end up reading like every classifier is some form of limited AGI.

Take [""Meet Norman the Psychopathic AI""](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008), an article by the BBC, whom I generally consider quite capable journalists.  While the research methodology and some of the implications are discussed in the article, the majority of laypeople who encounter the article will likely erroneously conclude that Norman possesses beliefs, a worldview, and some dark outlook on humanity.  Some readers will think ""Norman"" is violent or dangerous, with a mind of his own.  A headline and an image go a long way in communication, especially online.

And this article is by far not the worst offender. Many news outlets perform much worse, publishing misleading, fearmongering, or sensationalist stories about ""some new AI"", borrowing from pop sci-fi tropes, with the star AI inevitably represented by lacklustre CG avatars bought off stock photo websites.

I remember having several discussions in the wake of the Facebook experiment where researchers had AIs communicate, and saw they developed a communication standard unreadable by humans.  Based on the articles that circulated afterwards, a significant number of people concluded ""they had to turn it off because they were on the verge of SKYNET"".

In the interests of doing more than just ranting: how do we deal with this as a community?  Should we be reaching out to journalists about these issues?  Is it our responsibility in interviews to communicate the limitations of the models we develop?

Personifying the projects we work on, and giving them human qualities, is certainly entertaining and helps market our research.  That said, it seems like a sizeable portion of the public has been misinformed about the state of machine learning research as a result.

What is OpenAI? I don't know anymore.
A non-profit that leveraged good will whilst silently giving out equity for [years](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1105137541970243584) prepping a shift to for-profit that is now seeking to license closed tech through a third party by segmenting tech under a banner of [pre](https://twitter.com/tsimonite/status/1153340994986766336)/post ""AGI"" technology?

The claim is that [AGI](https://twitter.com/woj_zaremba/status/1105149945118519296) needs to be carefully and collaboratively guided into existence yet the output of almost [every](https://github.com/facebookresearch) [other](https://github.com/google-research/google-research) [existing](https://github.com/salesforce) [commercial](https://github.com/NVlabs) lab is more open. OpenAI runs a closed ecosystem where they primarily don't or won't trust outside of a small bubble.

I say this knowing many of the people there and with past and present love in my heart—I don't collaborate with OpenAI as I have no freaking clue what they're doing. Their primary form of communication is high entropy blog posts that'd be shock pivots for any normal start-up.

I have mentioned this to friends there and say all of this with positive sum intentions: I understand they have lofty aims, I understand they need cash to shovel into the forever unfurling GPU forge, but if they want any community trust long term they need a better strategy.

The implicit OpenAI message heard over the years:
“Think of how transformative and dangerous AGI may be. Terrifying. Trust us. Whether it's black-boxing technology, legal risk, policy initiatives, investor risk, ...—trust us with everything. We're good. No questions, sorry.”

10ivzyj,datascience,1674425913.0,"My 2.5 year stint at Amazon ended this week and I wanted to write about my experience there, primarily as a personal reflection but also sharing hoping it might be an interesting read here.. also curious to hear few other experiences in other companies.

i came up with 5 points that I found were generally interesting looking back or where I learned something useful.

1. Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.  
My first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it’s intended benefits. Given my new-hire energy/naivete, I did lots of in-depth research (even bought Pearl’s causal inference book), spent weekends reading/thinking about it and finally drafted a publication-quality document detailing causal graphs, mediation modeling, hypothesis tests etc etc…. On the day, I go into the meeting expecting an invigorating discussion of my analysis.. only to see the PMs gloss over all that detail and move straight to discussing what the delta-metric meant for them. my action item from that meeting was to draft a 1-pager with key findings to distribute among leadership. I clearly remember my reaction after that meeting- *that was it?*

2. Leadership principles - Granted this is my first tech experience, but I always presumed a company’s marketing material is sufficiently decoupled from its daily operations to the point where the vision/mission/culture code doesn’t actually propagate to your desk. but leadership principles at amazon are genuinely used as guide-markers for daily decision making. I would encounter an LP being the basis of a doc section, meeting discussion or piece of employee feedback almost every week. One benefit for example, is the template it provides for evaluating candidates after job interviews.

3. Writing is greatly valued practice at Amazon, and considered a forcing function for clarity of thought. I saw the benefits from writing my own docs but more so in reading other people’s docs. its also way more efficient by allowing multiple threads of comments/feedback to happen in parallel during the reading session vs a QnA session with a few people hogging all the time. On a related note, i wondered on multiple occasions how senior execs enjoy their work given all they do is read docs all day with super-human efficiency (not that they read the whole doc of-course but still..).

4. self-marketing and finding good projects - this was one of those vague truths that nobody will tell you but everyone slowly realizes esp in big companies, or atleast was true in my case. Every person needs to look after their own career progression by finding good projects, surround themselves with the right people (starting with manager) and of-course deliver the actual work. it might be easy to only focus on 3 believing 1 and 2 are out of control but i feel they’re equally important. example- one of my active contribution areas was for a product that, somewhere along the way, got pushed to a sister org, but I was wedged deep into the inner-workings that they had me continue working on it throughout my time. At the time, I felt important to be irreplaceable but what it really meant was that this work was not aligned with MY org's goals. doh! guess which org’s metrics will mean more to your perf review panel come the end of the year.

5. more projects are self-initiated than i realized. piggy-backing on the previous point about good projects- there is lesser well-thought-through strategy around you than it seems but also more opportunity to find the projects that interest you with potential for outsized impact. example- my most impactful project was a self-initiated one launched to production with a definitively large impact on the product metrics... and it didn't begin as an ‘over-the-line’ item (i.e. planned in the quarterly planning cycle) with a dedicated PM, roadmaps etc. it was just me finding an inefficiency and building a solution and even got it published in an internal conference. this may not be ideal but shows its possible to find areas for impact.   
I also know of at-least 2 other self-initiated projects that evolved to be core to the org’s efforts. This aligns with why companies hold hackathons, google has its 20%-time allowance etc. it also makes you wonder, how much of the OKR, OP, 3YAP etc are actually driving innovation vs designed to create an artificial sense of planning. (jargon expansion- objective key results, operational planning, 3 year action plan)

that's it. for me, this was a rewarding experience and grateful for the people I got to work with. I hope some of this useful to some of you folks, especially to junior data scientists, or an interesting read at the least.

They talk about how their accuracies are great but their models don't outperform a constant model by 1 point (the datasets can be very unbalanced). This is a literal example. I've seen it more than once.

I can't seem to get some teams to grasp that confusion matrices are important - having more false negatives than true positives can be bad in a high stakes model. It's not always, to be fair, but in certain models it certainly can be.

And then they race to get it into production and pat themselves on the back for how much money they are going to save the firm and present to a bunch of non-technical folks who think that analytics is amazing.

In the 1950s, Frederick Herzberg developed a theory that states there are two dimensions to job satisfaction: motivation and hygiene. 

Hygiene factors can minimize dissatisfaction at work, but they can’t make you love your job. These are factors like salary, supervision, and working conditions.

When you look back at the best moments of your career, they won’t really include the perks or the free lunches you got.

Instead, you’ll look back and remember the *motivators*. These are factors like recognition and achievement. They mean that your work is challenging and that you’re learning about topics that you’re intrinsically interested in. 

These are the factors that’ll be the predominant source of your work satisfaction and what contribute to your personal growth.

Here’s the thing though. If the hygiene areas aren’t properly addressed, you won’t feel satisfied regardless of how fulfilling your work is.

No matter how challenging and exciting your work is, if you’re not getting paid what you deserve, you’ll constantly have a nagging thought at the back of your head telling you to leave.

On the other hand, *only* having hygiene areas resolved is the reason why you constantly think something’s missing. You’re puzzled over *why* you’d be unhappy - you have a high status job, plenty of cash, and great coworkers.

But we need challenge and growth to drive us forward. And that’s why the motivators are integral. Without the motivators, we go to bed at night dreaming about what we’d be doing in an alternative world. Just look at these Hacker News posts ([link](https://preview.redd.it/ed99k3mjsfq61.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d640a23b0b37726ffdb4a3a5cc872601eae7f9)). 

The reason this can be hard to identify in our day to day is because we wrongly assume that just because we’re not fully unsatisfied, we must be satisfied. And when we inevitably don’t get that resounding feeling of congruence with our work, we get puzzled.

One of my favorite examples of someone who prioritized her intrinsic motivators over factors like money or status is [Kristina Lustig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinalustig/). She quit her high paying Director of Design job to retrain as a Software Developer.

It might not have made sense to others around her, but only Kristina knew what motivated her intrinsically.

**Loss Aversion**

Let’s assume you realize you want to make a career change into something more rewarding. Your brain is going to freak out.

It’s going to start screaming:

* What if I don’t like my new job as much as my current one?
* What if I don’t end up happier?
* I can’t change if i don’t make as much money.

The key to overcome this thinking is to *separate short term losses from long term losses.*

So here are a few examples:

* **Short Term**: In the short term, my salary will drop. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, why can't it exceed what I'm making right now?
* **Short Term:** I might have to take an entry level role which feels like a big drop from my current position. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I not only be in a more senior position but also a few steps closer to doing work I enjoy?
* **Short Term**: I might have to give up the stability of my current role. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I have stability and a new skillset I can leverage?

**The Next Thing**

It’s really easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the nicer office, the next pay raise, or the more prestigious title is what will make us happy. After all, it’s what your friends and family see. It’s the labels that stick.

Instead, we should aim to ask a different set of questions:

* Is this work meaningful to me?
* Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?
* Am I going to learn new things?
* Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
* Am I going to be given responsibility?

These are the things that will truly motivate you. The rest is just noise.

/r/machinelearning is growing rampantly, with over a thousand new subscribers *every day*. As our community grows, it is important to have fertile ground for newcomers to learn the ropes. Since there is already an active subreddit for aiding in the development of machine learning skills, we feel that this is the right time to demarcate the content between these two subs.


As a new rule, all beginner-level content should be posted to our sister sub, /r/learnmachinelearning.  This will free up “real estate” on our page for more in-depth, expert discussions and provide a more focused learning space for beginners.  That’s not to say that all tutorials are outright banned — in particular, explanations of recent or niche papers are still welcome.

We were all beginners once and newcomers to ML are bringing great things to this sub and the general community. Please do continue to engage with and learn from the community here. But we recommend /r/learnmachinelearning if you do want to start getting your hands dirty. 

We hope that this specialization will be beneficial to everyone in the long run.

We are thrilled to announce the public release of SpeechBrain (finally)!SpeechBrain is an open-source toolkit designed to speedup research and development of speech technologies.  It is flexible, modular, easy-to-use and well documented.

[https://speechbrain.github.io/](https://speechbrain.github.io/?fbclid=IwAR289EnrgVB9UG_yJFDu_K36kG321wCFiwu1n9D-dOc7-zfDb4sATMKRk5k)

Our amazing collaborators worked so hard for more than one year and we hope our efforts will be helpful for the speech and machine learning communities.

SpeechBrain currently supports speech recognition, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, spoken language understanding, speech enhancement, speech separation and multi-microphone signal processing. For all these tasks we have competitive or state-of-the-art performance (see [https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)).

SpeechBrain can foster research on speech technology.  It can be useful for pure machine learning scientists as well as companies or students that can easily plug their model into SpeechBrain.

We think that speechbrain can also be suitable for beginners. According to our experience and numerous beta testers,  you just need few hours to familiarize yourself with the toolkit.  To you in this process, we prepared many interactive tutorials (Google Colab).

Pretrained models are available on HuggingFace so anyone can do ASR, speaker verification, source separation or more with only a few lines of code! ([https://huggingface.co/speechbrain](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain))

xxmctx,datascience,1665107046.0,"I don't post often on Reddit, but I feel the need to speak out about a recent experience.

I'm a recent grad, May of 2021 with a B.A in Data Science & Statistics (it's an applied math degree). Although I'm a new grad, I'm fortunate to have 1.5 years of professional experience as a data analyst, spanning one internship and two contract roles. However, I am trying to get my foot in the door as a Data Scientist, and am currently participating in an Applied Data Science Program in lieu of a master's (I have my own philosophy of getting a master's degree AKA its too much money and I'd rather use all available resources at my disposal first)

Anywho, the market has been a bit tough in NYC, as I've been unemployed for the last 4 months. I've had countless interviews, final rounds, but the last role eventually gets passed along to another candidate. I'm a good sport about it- until I was contacted by an IT company called Synergistic IT.

They had an entry-level Data Scientist role that I measly applied to. After swiftly scheduling an interview, the day of our phone interview came. It felt rushed, and wasn't very technical. The person over the phone eventually came to describe that this is not a paid role, but rather a service that ""trains"" you until you find a data science role, and that they're a valid IT company that they will allow you to add to your resume. Also, you had to pay for it.

It felt cheap, and my scam radar went off. So I decided to play bait and ask how much it was. The ""interviewer"" became visibly upset when I expressed a level of shock when he told me it was \~$15,000. As I quickly informed him that I was not interested, he tried to get me on the phone and associate my lack of experience in data science to why I cannot enter data science.

""You don't have experience, right? So you pay us, we give you experience, then when your job comes, you will be ok""

I'm sure there's plenty of reasons why I don't have a data science job (yet). But I'm sure by the way this ""interview"" was conducted, this opportunity was nothing more than to exploit new grads with little experience by offering ""experience"".

khin4c,MachineLearning,1608561621.0,"According to [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out/) article:

**Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals**

Montreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals.

Materials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled.

Also losing out are co-founders Jean-François Gagné, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of “deep learning,” the foundational science behind today’s AI revolution.

Between them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal.

The shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises.

The circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million.

The sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada’s AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding – $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover.

Element AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms.

Element AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called “supercredibility,” recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver “AI for good,” and its ranks swelled to 500 people.

But the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers.

It was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen & Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals.

But Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020.

Element did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing – roughly half of the amount – at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI’s enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year.

“However, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche … were not going to be met in a timely manner,” the circular reads. It states “new terms were proposed” for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose “other operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.” Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June.

As talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, “the company’s liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,” the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said.

As part of the deal – which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI’s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business – the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/khin4c/n_montrealbased_element_ai_sold_for_230million_as/,[N] Montreal-based Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out,News,522,214,0.99

Semantic search using vectors does an amazing job when we look at sentences, or short paragraphs. Vectors also do well as an implementation for image search. Unfortunately, vector representations for video, long documents and other more complex data types perform poorly.

The reason isn't really to do with embeddings themselves not being good enough. If you asked a human to find the most relevant document to some search query given a list of long documents, an important question comes to mind - do we want the document that on average is most relevant to your query or the document that has a specific sentence that is very relevant to your search query?

Furthermore, what if the document has multiple components to it? Should we match based on the title of the document? Is that important? Or is the content more important?

These questions arn't things that we can expect an AI algorithm to solve for us, they need to be encoded into each specific search experience and use case.

**Introducing Tensor Search**

We believe that it is possible to tackle this problem by changing the way we think about semantic search - specifically, through *tensor search*.

By deconstructing documents and other data types into configurable chunks which are then vectorised we give users control over the way their documents are searched and represented. We can have any combination the user desires - should we do an average? A maximum? Weight certain components of the document more or less? Do we want to be more specific and target a specific sentence or less specific and look at the whole document?

Further, explainability is vastly improved - we can return as a ""highlight"" the exact content that matched the search query. Therefore, the user can see exactly where the query matched, even if they are dealing with long and complex data types like videos or long documents.

We dig in a bit more into the ML specifics next.

**The trouble with BERT on long documents - quadratic attention**

When we come to text, the vast majority of semantic search applications are using attention based algos like SBERT. Attention tapers off quadratically with sequence length, so subdividing sequences into multiple vectors means that we can significantly improve relevance.

**The disk space, relevance tradeoff**

Tensors allow you to trade disk space for search accuracy. You could retrain an SBERT model and increase the number of values in the embeddings and hence make the embeddings more descriptive, but this is quite costly (particularly if you want to leverage existing ML models). A better solution is instead to chunk the document into smaller components and vectorise those, increasing accuracy at the cost of disk space (which is relatively cheap).

**Tensor search for the general case**

We wanted to build a search engine for semantic search similar to something like Solr or Elasticsearch, where no matter what you throw at it, it can process it and make it searchable. With Marqo, it will use vectors were it can or expand to tensors where necessary - it also allows you the flexibility to specify specific chunking strategies to build out the tensors. Finally, Marqo is still a work in progress, but is at least something of an end-to-end solution - it has a number of features such as:

\- a query DSL language for pre-filtering results (includes efficient keyword, range and boolean queries)  
\- efficient approximate knn search powered by HNSW  
\- onnx support, multi-gpu support  
\- support for reranking

q0n0u7,datascience,1633283916.0,"Because after a few years of constantly learning and working hard as an analyst, I have accepted a new position as a data scientist at a different company!

My first job was at a small startup-ish company was very new to wanting to use data to drive decision making. The original analyst they had copy-pasted CSVs by hand did everything in Excel pivot tables. I was fresh out of college with my applied math degree, and after 130+ applications I was happy to finally get a job. After learning more about the data this company worked with, I decided there has to be a better way, and I would power through the process. The true thing my undergraduate degree really taught me how to do was break down daunting problems into achievable steps and how to google the right questions, and it was now time to put that to the test.


Taking what measly bit of Python I knew, I started doing things like combining data in pandas and creating analyses in python to allow the data to scale past Excel's limitations. Once I had a working product, I always researched how I could write more efficient code. It took a lot of StackExchange and pandas documentation reading, always trying to learn new processes and techniques. Now I consider myself a data wrangling expert and confident in my Python skills. 

It wasn't an easy road and it really depends on the work you're willing to put into it. There were many times I wanted to give up, let up on the gas and just coast for awhile. But I knew I had to keep going if I wanted to become a data scientist. All the struggles I dealt with, the extremely messy data, researching new techniques to visualize and analyze data extremely helped me get through the interviews and prove I was up for the job at hand - and finally receive that sweet, sweet offer letter.

I also wanted to say thank you because this subreddit has helped me a lot. I don't frequently submit and comment, but reading many different posts and comments has greatly helped me on my career journey. I am just excited and wanted to tell people about it.

I do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. 

The most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just ""done for you"" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. 

The machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.

The main structure for the course is to:

* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.
* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.
* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.

We're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. 

At least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.

All tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. 

We've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.

If all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us!

These efforts include increasing AI research investment, unleashing  Federal AI computing and data resources, setting AI technical standards,  building America’s AI workforce, and engaging with our international  allies.
* The [Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Charter-Select-Committee-on-AI-Jan-2021-posted.pdf),  launched by the White House in 2018 to coordinate Federal AI efforts,  is being expanded and made permanent, and will serve as the senior  interagency body referenced in the Act that is responsible for  overseeing the National AI Initiative.
* The [National AI Research Institutes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/trump-administration-investing-1-billion-research-institutes-advance-industries-future/)  announced by the White House and the National Science Foundation in  2020 were codified into law. These collaborative research and education  institutes will focus on a range of AI R&D areas, such as machine  learning, synthetic manufacturing, precision agriculture, and extreme  weather prediction.
* Regular updates to the national [AI R&D strategic plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National-AI-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2019-Update-June-2019.pdf), which were initiated by the White House in 2019, are codified into law.
* Critical [AI technical standards](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf) activities directed by the White House in 2019 are expanded to include an AI risk assessment framework.
* The [prioritization of AI related data, cloud, and high-performance computing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/accelerating-americas-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/)  directed by the White House in 2019 are expanded to include a plan for a  National AI Research Resource providing compute resources and datasets  for AI research.

Repo Link: [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions)

The dataset has roughly 3.3M images (all of them are hosted and some links are now broken).  Also:

* Refusal to share pretrained models making benchmarking and reporting numbers super hard (not everyone has 1k TPUs at their helm):  [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/3](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/3)
* Refusal to share Alt-text associated with each image (the title of the paper quite ironically is \`Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-text Dataset For Automatic Image Captioning\`): [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/6](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/6)
* Refusal to share images / mirror links (while I agree the there are legal issues, but with several hundred images missing from the dataset it becomes superhard for the community to compare models): [https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/1](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions/issues/1)

It is extremely painful to see that after so many elaborate attempts made by Google (Colab, Dataset search engine etc, for which I am greatly thankful!) to promote open research, such instances happen.

I hope that people from the community realize that a dataset paper is a big responsibility to carry on one's shoulder and if there are legal issues which hinder sharing of datasets - publishing a paper on a private data is fine (with some fields not made public like Alt-text), but hosting a challenge on the same w/o releasing models or entire dataset doesn't seem supercool to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/agiatj/d_google_ai_refuses_to_share_dataset_fields_for_a/,[D] Google AI refuses to share dataset fields for a dataset paper (ACL'18) and associated challenge (at CVPR'19),Discussion,510,103,0.96
10v75gc,datascience,1675691633.0,"On LinkedIn I see more and more people labeling them as data scientists, AI experts and what-not offering paid courses, interview training and resume review. Often, they have a non-data-science background and very little experience working as a professional. Quite common to show a previous job as a data scientist with a tenure less than 1 year (or multiple).

I know it can be appealing, as their message is often, everyone can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or AI expert. Academic and professional degrees are overrated and it’s enough to take a Udemy or Coursera course to become a data scientist (affiliate link included). Simply follow them and buy their resources (which is usually very general advice, you can google in a few minutes).

But the reality is: They are usually not the experts they pretend to be. They typically don’t talk about expert topics, they talk about career, current hypes, and about very high-level projects. Sometimes they have a GitHub account, but they have no commits of just copy-pasted repositories from other people and some very basic entry-level stuff. They are usually on LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube and in podcasts, but never talking about expert topics.

Don’t trust these people and don’t buy courses there. Everything you need is either free of charge or it’s a professional degree. There is no easy-going way to become an expert in any topic. The only good advice these people can give is how to become a fake AI influencer.

phvgzb,MachineLearning,1630775433.0,"*“The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these  laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble”,* said the renowned British quantum physicist Paul Dirac in 1929 \[1\]. Dirac implied that all physical phenomena can be simulated down to the quantum, from protein folding to material failures and climate change. The only problem is that the governing equations are too complex to be solved at realistic time-scales.

Does this mean that we can never achieve real-time physics simulations?  Well, physicists have a knack for developing models, methods, and approximations to achieve the desired results in shorter  timescales. With all the advancements in research, software, and  hardware technology, real-time simulation has only been made possible at the classical limit which is most evident in video game physics.

Simulating physical phenomena such as collisions, deformations, fracture, and fluid flow are computationally intensive, yet models have been developed that simulate such phenomena in real-time within games. Of course there have been a lot of simplifications and optimizations of different algorithms to make it happen. The fastest method is rigid body physics. This is what most games are based on where objects can collide and rebound without deforming. Objects are represented by  convex collision boxes which surround the object, and when two objects collide, the collision is detected in real-time and appropriate forces are applied to simulate the impact. There are no deformations or fractures  in this representation. The video game ‘Teardown’ is potentially the  pinnacle of rigid body physics.

[ Teardown, a fully interactive voxel-based game, uses rigid-body physics solvers to simulate destruction.](https://i.redd.it/cla44l1sqil71.gif)

Although rigid body physics is good for simulating non-deformable collisions, it is not suitable for  deformable materials such as hair and clothes which games heavily rely on. This is where soft-body dynamics comes in. Below, you can see four methods for simulating deformable objects in the order of complexity:

# Spring-Mass Model

The  name is totally self-explanatory. Objects are represented by a system of point masses that are connected to each other via springs. You can think of it as a network of one-dimensional Hooke’s law in a 3D setup. The main drawbacks of this model is that it requires a lot of manual work in setting up the mass-spring network, and there isn’t a rigorous relationship between material properties and model parameters. Nonetheless, the model has been implemented exceptionally well in   ‘BeamNG.Drive’, a real-time vehicle simulator that is based on spring-mass model to simulate vehicle deformations.

[ BeamNG.Drive uses spring-mass models to simulate car crash deformations.](https://i.redd.it/6chnk51pqil71.gif)

# Position-based Dynamics (PBD)

The methods of simulating kinematics are generally based on force-based models where the particle accelerations are calculated from Newton’s  second law, and then integrated to obtain the velocities and positions at every time step. In position-based dynamics, the positions are computed directly through solving a quasi-static problem involving a set of equations that include constraints. PBD is less accurate but faster than a forced-based approach, making it ideal for applications in games, animation films, and visual effects. The movement of hair and clothes in games are generally simulated through this model. PBD is not limited to deformable solids, but can also be used to simulate rigid body systems and fluids. Here is an excellent survey on PBD methods \[2\].

# Finite-Element Method (FEM)

The finite element method of computing deformations in materials is based on numerically solving the stress-strain equations based on the elastic field theory. It is essentially solving the 3D Hookes law in 3D. The material is divided into finite elements, usually tetrahedra, and the  stress and strain on vertices are calculated at every time step through  solving a linear matrix equation. FEM is a mesh-based approach to simulating soft-body dynamics. It is very accurate and the model parameters are directly related to material properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio. FEM simulations for engineering applications are generally not real-time, but recently AMD, one of the largest   semiconductor companies, released its multi-threaded FEM library for games called FEMFX that simulated material deformations in real-time.

# Material Point Method (MPM)

MPM is a highly accurate mesh-free method which is much more suitable than mesh-based methods for simulating large deformations, fractures, multi-material systems and viscoelastic fluids because of its improved efficiency and resolution. MPM is currently the state-of-the-art of mesh-free hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian methods, developed as a generalization to older methods such as Particle in Cell (PIC) and Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP). MPM simulations are not real-time, and state-of-the art simulations take about half a minute per frame for systems involving about a million points. Here is a comprehensive course notes on MPM \[3\].

# Machine Learning and Physics Simulations

So what does Machine Learning have to do with all this? Well you have probably already noticed that there is always a trade-off between computation speed and accuracy/resolution. With physics solvers having been optimized enormously over the past few decades, there is little room left for step-change improvements. 

Here is where Machine Learning comes in. Recent research by Oxford  \[5\],  Ubisoft La Forge \[6\], DeepMind \[7,8\], and ETH Zurich \[9\] demonstrate  that a deep neural network can learn physics interactions  and emulate them multiple orders of magnitude faster. This is done through generating millions of simulation data, feeding them through the neural network for training, and using the trained model to emulate  what a  physics solver would do. Although the offline process would take a  lot of time in generating data and training the model, the trained neural network model is much faster at simulating the physics. For instance, the researchers at Oxford \[5\] developed a method called Deep Emulator Network Search (DENSE) that accelerates simulations up to 2 billion times, and they demonstrated this in 10 scientific case studies including astrophysics, climate, fusion, and high energy physics.

In the gaming sector, Ubisoft La Forge’s team used a simple feed-forward network that trains on the vertex positions of 3D mesh objects at three subsequent time frames and learns to predict the next  frame \[6\]. The model essentially compares the predictions with the known positions from the simulated datasets, and back-propagates to adjust  the model parameters to minimize the error in making predictions. The team used Maya’s nCloth physics solver to generate simulation data which is an advanced spring-mass model optimized for cloths. They also implemented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to only train on the most important bases. The results were astounding. The neural network could emulate the physics up to 5000 times faster than the physics solver.

[ Fast data-driven physics simulations of cloths and squishy materials \[6\].](https://preview.redd.it/uutv7phksil71.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a7617dedacd64dc466269c09fbb4c67e7cfa3e4)

Watch video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg)

Another recent work by Peter Battaglia’s team at DeepMind achieved astonishing results with graph networks \[7\]. Unlike traditional neural networks where each layer of nodes is connected to every node in the next layer, a graph neural network has a graph-like structure. With this  model, they managed to simulate a wide range of materials including  sand, water, goop, and rigid solids. Instead of predicting the positions of particles, the model predicts the accelerations, and the velocities and  positions are computed using an Euler integration. The simulation  data  were generated using a range of physics solvers including PBD, SPH (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) and MPM. The model was not optimized for speed and therefore it was not significantly faster than the physics solvers, but certainly it demonstrated what can be made possible when Machine Learning meets physics.

Watch video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7h9zF8OO7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7h9zF8OO7E)

This field is still in its infancy, but certainly we will be observing new ML-based technologies that enhance physics simulations. There are just so many models for simulating any physical phenomena at all scales and complexities, ranging from quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics  to  microstructure and classical physics, and the potential opportunities to create value from the duo of Machine learning and Physics are immense.

[Yuno](https://reddit.com/link/rd3oby/video/usbwwme58o481/player)

This is the search engine that I have  been working on past 6 months. Working on it for quite some time now, I  am confident that the search engine is now usable.

source code: [**Yuno**](https://github.com/IAmPara0x/yuno)

Try Yuno on (both notebooks has UI):

1. [**kaggle notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/yunoo/)  (recommended notebook)
2. [**colab notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WAewYgHDmDEWhPBBOvGgyLTiOaasVyOz?usp=sharing)

My Research on [**Yuno**](https://medium.com/@confusedstudent13/yuno-context-based-search-engine-for-anime-39f5cb86f845)**.**

# What does it do?

Basically  you can type what kind of anime you are looking for and then Yuno will analyze and compare more **0.5 Million** reviews and other anime information  that are in it's index and then it will return those animes that might  contain qualities that you are looking. [r/Animesuggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/) is the inspiration for this search engine, where people essentially does the same thing.

# How does it do?

This is my favourite part, the idea is pretty simple it goes like this.

Let says that, I am looking for *an romance anime with tsundere female MC.*

**If  I read every review of an anime that exists on the Internet, then I  will be able to determine if this anime has the qualities that I am  looking for or n**ot.

or framing differently,

**The  more reviews I read about an anime, the more likely I am to decide  whether this particular anime has some of the qualities that I am  looking for.**

&#x200B;

Consider a section of a review from anime ***Oregairu:***

>Yahari Ore isn’t the first anime to tackle the anti-social protagonist,  but it certainly captures it perfectly with its characters and deadpan  writing . It’s charming, funny and yet bluntly realistic . You may go  into this expecting a typical rom-com but will instead come out of it  lashed by the harsh views of our characters .

Just By reading this much of review, we can conclude that this anime has:

1. anti-social protagonist
2. realistic romance and comedy

If we will read more reviews about this anime we can find more qualities about it.

If this is the case, then reviews must contain enough information about that particular anime to satisfy to query like mentioned above. Therefore all  I have to do is create a method that reads and analyzes different anime  reviews.

# But, How can I train a model to understand anime reviews without any kind of labelled dataset?

This  question took me some time so solve, after banging my head against the wall for quite sometime I managed to do it and it goes like this.

**Let** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **be two different anime such that they don’t share any genres among them, then the sufficiently large reviews of anime** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **will have totally different content.**

This idea is inverse to the idea of web link analysis which says,

**Hyperlinks in web documents indicate content relativity,relatedness and connectivity among the linked article.**

**That's pretty much it idea, how well does it works?**

&#x200B;

[Fig1: 10K reviews plotted from 1280D to 2D using TSNE](https://preview.redd.it/d3hzr8gf8o481.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97b575724b4fc3c78c16438c701e496a9b3c1dd1)

&#x200B;

As, you will able to see in **Fig1** that there are several clusters of different reviews, and **Fig2** is a zoomed-in version of **Fig1,** here the reviews of re:zero and it's sequel are very close to each other.But, *In our definition we never mentioned that an anime and it's sequel should close to each other.*  And this is not the only case, every anime and it's sequel are very  close each other (if you want to play and check whether this is the case  or not you can do so in this interactive [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/anime-search-visualization) which contains more than 100k reviews).

&#x200B;

Since,  this method doesn't use any kind of handcrafted labelled training data  this method easily be extended to different many domains like: [r/booksuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/), [r/MovieSuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/) . which i think is pretty cool.

&#x200B;

# Context Indexer

This is my favourite indexer coz it will solve a very crucial problem that is mentioned bellow.

Consider a query like: *romance anime with medieval setting and with revenge plot.*

Finding such a review about such anime is difficult because not all review talks about same thing of about that particular anime .

For eg:  consider a anime like [Yona of the Dawn](https://anilist.co/anime/20770/Akatsuki-no-Yona)

This anime has:

1. great character development
2. medieval theme
3. romance theme
4. revenge plot

Not all reviews of this anime will mention about all of the four things mention, some review will talk about romance theme or revenge plot. This means that we need to somehow ""remember"" all the reviews before deciding whether this anime contains what we are looking for or not.

I have talked about it in the great detail in the mention article above if you are interested.

&#x200B;

**Note:**  
  please avoid doing these two things otherwise search results will be very bad.

1. Don't make spelling mistakes in the query (coz there is no auto word correction)
2. Don't type nouns in the query like anime names or character names, just properties you are looking for.  
**eg**: don't type: anime like attack on titans

type: action anime with great plot and character development.

  
This is because Yuno hadn't ""watched"" any anime. It just reads reviews that's why it doesn't know what attack on titans is.   


&#x200B;

If  you have any questions regarding Yuno, please let me know I will be  more than happy to help you. Here's my discord ID (I Am ParadØx#8587).

Thank You.

k77sxz,MachineLearning,1607176259.0,"First off, why a megathread? Since the first thread went up 1 day ago, we've had 4 different threads on this topic, all with large amounts of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Considering that a large part of the community likely would like to avoid politics/drama altogether, the continued proliferation of threads is not ideal. We don't expect that this situation will die down anytime soon, so to consolidate discussion and prevent it from taking over the sub, we decided to establish a megathread.

Second, why didn't we do it sooner, or simply delete the new threads? The initial thread had very little information to go off of, and we eventually locked it as it became too much to moderate.  Subsequent threads provided new information, and (slightly) better discussion.

Third, several commenters have asked why we allow drama on the subreddit in the first place. Well, we'd prefer if drama never showed up. Moderating these threads is a massive time sink and quite draining. However, it's clear that a substantial portion of the ML community would like to discuss this topic. Considering that r/machinelearning is one of the only communities capable of such a discussion, we are unwilling to ban this topic from the subreddit.

Overall, making a comprehensive megathread seems like the best option available, both to limit drama from derailing the sub, as well as to allow informed discussion.

We will be closing new threads on this issue, locking the previous threads, and updating this post with new information/sources as they  arise. If there any sources you feel should be added to this megathread, comment below or send a message to the mods.

TL;DR: I've written a ""textbook"" for neural differential equations (NDEs). Includes ordinary/stochastic/controlled/rough diffeqs, for learning physics, time series, generative problems etc. [+ Unpublished material on generalised adjoint methods, symbolic regression, universal approximation, ...]

Hello everyone! I've been posting on this subreddit for a while now, mostly about either tech stacks (JAX vs PyTorch etc.) -- or about ""neural differential equations"", and more generally the places where physics meets machine learning.

If you're interested, then I wanted to share that my doctoral thesis is now available online! Rather than the usual staple-papers-together approach, I decided to go a little further and write a 231-page kind-of-a-textbook.

[If you're curious how this is possible: most (but not all) of the work on NDEs has been on ordinary diffeqs, so that's equivalent to the ""background""/""context"" part of a thesis. Then a lot of the stuff on controlled, stochastic, rough diffeqs is the ""I did this bit"" part of the thesis.]

This includes material on:

- neural ordinary diffeqs: e.g. for learning physical systems, as continuous-time limits of discrete architectures, includes theoretical results on expressibility;
- neural controlled diffeqs: e.g. for modelling functions of time series, handling irregularity;
- neural stochastic diffeqs: e.g. for sampling from complicated high-dimensional stochastic dynamics;
- numerical methods: e.g. the new class of reversible differential equation solvers, or the problem of Brownian reconstruction.

And also includes a bunch of previously-unpublished material -- mostly stuff that was ""half a paper"" in size so I never found a place to put it. Including:

- Neural ODEs can be universal approximators even if their vector fields aren't.
- A general approach to backpropagating through ordinary/stochastic/whatever differential equations, via rough path theory. (Special cases of this -- e.g. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle -- have been floating around for decades.) Also includes some readable meaningful special cases if you're not familiar with rough path theory ;)
- Some new symbolic regression techniques for dynamical systems (joint work with Miles Cranmer) by combining neural differential equations with genetic algorithms (regularised evolution).
- What make effective choices of vector field for neural differential equations; effective choices of interpolations for neural CDEs; other practical stuff like this.

If you've made it this far down the post, then [here's a sneak preview](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) of the brand-new accompanying software library, of differential equation solvers in JAX. More about that when I announce it officially next week ;)

To wrap this up! My hope is that this can serve as a reference for the current state-of-the-art in the field of neural differential equations. [So here's the arXiv link again](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435), and let me know what you think. And finally for various musings, marginalia, extra references, and open problems, you might like the ""comments"" section at the end of each chapter.

However, now that I'm doing a statistics MS, my perspective has completely flipped. Much of what we're learning is *completely* useless for private sector data science, from my experience. So much pointless math for the sake of math. Incredibly tedious computations. Complicated proofs of irrelevant theorems. Psets that require 20 hours or more to complete, simply because the computations are so intense (page-long integrals, etc.). What's the point?

There's basically no working with data. How can you train in statistics without working with real data? There's no real world value to any of this. My skills as a data scientist/applied statistician are not improving.

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g20x47/100days_data_science_challenge/,100-days Data Science Challenge!,Education,496,66,0.98
ckdnkf,datascience,1564603533.0,"There are a whole lot of resources out there discussing how to get your first job in data science, but relatively few about getting that second, third, and fourth job once you’ve finally broken in and paid your dues. To that end, I thought I’d share some statistics and commentary about my most recent job search.

Background: Based out of New York. MS in Statistics, 4+ years in data science proper at 2 different companies, a few years in related quant roles before that.

Current company: a fairly large org in a traditional industry, currently trying to rebrand itself as a tech company, with mixed results so far. Despite our best efforts, data science hasn’t really found its place yet, and probably never will. That was the main reason for my job search.

&#x200B;

The Numbers:

131: companies I applied to, using a mix of online apps, recruiters, and referrals/networking

77: initial callbacks

7: companies I applied to twice and got an interview on the second try

25: take home assignments or HackerRank challenges I was asked to complete

8: take homes I actually did

9: whiteboard or coderpad sessions

5: whiteboard sessions I totally fucked up

18: onsites I was invited to

12: onsites I actually went to

4: times I was ghosted after a final round onsite

42: hours I spent onsite

3: offers I ended up getting

5: months it took from initial round of apps to finally accepting an offer

100: the lowest base salary I was quoted (in thousands)

195: the highest base salary I was quoted

160: the median base salary

&#x200B;

The Aftermath:

Yes, it’s a lot easier to get interviews and callbacks when you’ve already got a data science job. That’s the good news. I don’t even consider myself a great data scientist, I’m probably 70th percentile at best. My GitHub is empty except for 1 side project I did 3 years ago. I don’t write cover letters. My professional network consists of lawyers and vagabonds. Turns out that’s enough! I turned down quite a number of interview requests and next steps. These were the most common reasons:

\-low pay

\-job was essentially product analytics

\-job was essentially software engineering

\-product or industry didn’t interest me

\-team was already quite mature, which makes it less exciting for me

The bad news is that it still takes a while to successfully secure an offer at a company that you actually want to work for. The challenge when you are an experienced candidate is no longer applying to jobs and hoping for a response. The challenge is carving out time (when you already have a day job) to conduct interviews and do take homes, and then hoping that you’re getting good vibes from the manager, the team, and the org at large. You now have the luxury of being picky about where you spend your time.

There are loads of companies who don’t know what they’re doing when it comes to data science or ML, and only a handful that do, while also having an interesting product/challenges and good comp. Everyone knows who those companies are, so everyone who’s good applies to them, and so the competition is still pretty fierce at the highest levels.

Startups vs Enterprise:

There was an interesting split in terms of callbacks by company size and type. I received a grand total of 1 callback from an “enterprise” company. The vast majority of my callbacks were from small-to-mid size companies that could colloquially be described as a “tech startup” or “tech-adjacent”, or through corporate recruiters who made first contact. After a while I stopped even applying to banks, media, insurance companies and any place that used legacy ATS software like Taleo or BrassRing (truly, the black hole of resumes). If they used Lever, Greenhouse or Jobvite instead, then I was golden. It’s funny to think that the course of your career could be so irrevocably shaped by shitty job posting software, but there you go.

Take Homes:

I don’t think anyone I know actively enjoys doing these but they’re apparently the new normal now so you gotta deal with them. The first few I did yielded poor results but over time I hit a nice groove. The key is to comment and explain everything you did (assumptions, reasoning, logic, commentary). My most successful take homes contained roughly the same amount of documentation as actual code.  I used the simplest methods I could because I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on these things, but I made sure to include a mini-report.

Something I Learned:

I eventually realized that the ideal interview process for me would frontload all the technical screening and reserve the onsite for conceptual or high level discussions.  Assign whatever coding screen, stats Q&A or homework you need before bringing someone in.  Ensure that everyone who makes it to your final round has already demonstrated sufficient technical chops.  There's nothing worse for a candidate than carving out a 4 hour chunk of time away from work, then showing up to someone's office just to flunk a whiteboard code sesh at the very top of the morning...and then having to interview for another 3 hours.  All it takes is one mistake and it could torpedo your chances.

Networking (bonus edit):

The thing with networking is that it works really well when it happens.  It's how I got one of my previous jobs: pretty much walked in for coffee and walked out with an offer.  Unfortunately, it's not a magic button you can just press when you need it.  There are a finite supply of senior DS jobs out there,, so you can't rely on it every time you need a change of scenery.  Definitely would recommend meeting people, getting your name out there, etc, but realize that it's more of a long term play than anything else.

Most Embarrassing/Annoying Moments (another bonus edit):

\-forgot how to write a window function

\-interviewer didn't believe common table expressions were valid SQL.  They totally are.

\-couldn't solve a string compression problem quickly/efficiently enough

\-blanked out on a binary search tree problem

\-couldn't quite explain how L1 regularization induces sparsity

\-""What is your greatest weakness?""  Seriously?

\-ghosted by the same company twice.  Fool me once...",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ckdnkf/recruiting_still_aint_easy_job_hunting_as_a/,Recruiting (Still) Ain’t Easy: Job Hunting as a Senior Data Scientist,Job Search,498,154,0.98

instead look at sections 1 2 8 9 10 where Jurgen mentions work they did long before Geoff, who did not cite, as confirmed by studying the references, at first glance it's not obvious, it's hidden, one has to work backwards from the references

[section 1, First Very Deep NNs, Based on Unsupervised Pre-Training (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201), Jurgen ""facilitated supervised learning in deep RNNs by unsupervised pre-training of a hierarchical stack of RNNs"" and soon was able to ""solve previously unsolvable Very Deep Learning tasks of depth > 1000,"" he mentions reference [UN4] which is actually Geoff's later similar work:

> More than a decade after this work [UN1], a similar method for more limited feedforward NNs (FNNs) was published, facilitating supervised learning by unsupervised pre-training of stacks of FNNs called Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) [UN4]. The 2006 justification was essentially the one I used in the early 1990s for my RNN stack: each higher level tries to reduce the description length (or negative log probability) of the data representation in the level below. 

back then unsupervised pre-training was a big deal, today it's not so important any more, see [section 19, From Unsupervised Pre-Training to Pure Supervised Learning (1991-95 and 2006-11)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) 

[section 2, Compressing / Distilling one Neural Net into Another (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%202), Jurgen also trained ""a student NN to imitate the behavior of the teacher NN,"" briefly referring to Geoff's much later similar work [DIST2]:

> I called this ""collapsing"" or ""compressing"" the behavior of one net into another. Today, this is widely used, and also called ""distilling"" [DIST2] or ""cloning"" the behavior of a teacher net into a student net. 

[section 9, Learning Sequential Attention with NNs (1990)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%209), Jurgen ""had both of the now common types of neural sequential attention: end-to-end-differentiable ""soft"" attention (in latent space) through multiplicative units within NNs [FAST2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf), and ""hard"" attention (in observation space) in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [ATT0](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-128-90ocr.pdf) [ATT1],"" the blog has a statement about Geoff's later similar work [ATT3](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4089-learning-to-combine-foveal-glimpses-with-a-third-order-boltzmann-machine.pdf) which I find both funny and sad: 

> My overview paper for CMSS 1990 [ATT2] summarised in Section 5 our early work on attention, to my knowledge the first implemented neural system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition & prediction component with an attentional component (the fixation controller). Two decades later, the reviewer of my 1990 paper wrote about his own work as second author of a related paper [ATT3]: ""To our knowledge, this is the first implemented system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition component ... with an attentional component (the fixation controller)."" 

similar in [section 10, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (1990)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2010), Jurgen introduced HRL ""with end-to-end differentiable NN-based subgoal generators [HRL0](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-129-90ocr.pdf), also with recurrent NNs that learn to generate sequences of subgoals [HRL1] [HRL2],"" referring to Geoff's later work [HRL3](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/714-feudal-reinforcement-learning.pdf):  

> Soon afterwards, others also started publishing on HRL. For example, the reviewer of our reference [ATT2] (which summarised in Section 6 our early work on HRL) was last author of ref [HRL3]

[section 8, End-To-End-Differentiable Fast Weights: NNs Learn to Program NNs (1991)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%208), Jurgen published a network ""that learns by gradient descent to quickly manipulate the fast weight storage"" of another network, and ""active control of fast weights through 2D tensors or outer product updates [FAST2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf),"" dryly referring to [FAST4a](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past.pdf) which happens to be Geoff's later similar paper: 

> A quarter century later, others followed this approach [FAST4a]

it's really true, Geoff did not cite Jurgen in any of these similar papers, and what's kinda crazy, he was editor of Jurgen's 1990 paper [ATT2](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/hinton-rev.pdf) summarising both attention learning and hierarchical RL, then later he published closely related work, sections 9, 10, but he did not cite 

Jurgen also [famously complained](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-conspiracy.html) that Geoff's deep learning survey in Nature neither mentions the inventors of backpropagation (1960-1970) nor ""the father of deep learning, Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, who published the first general, working learning algorithms for deep networks"" in 1965 

apart from the early pioneers in the 60s and 70s, like Ivaknenko and Fukushima, most of the big deep learning concepts stem from Jurgen's team with Sepp and Alex and Dan and others: unsupervised pre-training of deep networks, artificial curiosity and GANs, vanishing gradients, LSTM for language processing and speech and everything, distilling networks, attention learning, CUDA CNNs that win vision contests, deep nets with 100+ layers, metalearning, plus theoretical work on optimal AGI and Godel Machine",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e3buo3/d_five_major_deep_learning_papers_by_geoff_hinton/,[D] Five major deep learning papers by Geoff Hinton did not cite similar earlier work by Jurgen Schmidhuber,Discussion,498,184,0.91

I think 2 features they use to rank candidates for recruiters are 1) how frequently the profile responds to recruiter messages, and 2) if you've used LinkedIn to apply for jobs. Other possible features might be how much you've used the site in general, and whether you've selected specific job titles you're interested in. I'd be interested to hear if others' experiences align. 

 My experience: when I first set myself as ""open to work"" on LinkedIn (only for recruiters, not publicly in my profile), I wasn't getting many recruiter messages, and the ones I did get were pretty low quality.  I still always responded to them pretty quickly with a rejection. Now, a few months later, I'm getting hit every day by a new recruiter, and the jobs are actually pretty relevant and interesting. Why the change?

I think LinkedIn tracks whether a profile responds to recruiter messages, and prioritizes profiles that communicate well with recruiters. 

Additionally, I recently started applying to some jobs on LinkedIn, whereas before I was just using Indeed. I think that has also increased how ""active"" LinkedIn considers me, and boosts me in recruiter searches.

sonjst,MachineLearning,1644439740.0,"I am trying to understand the ""why"" of neural network architecture. I've been reading papers and looking at winning solutions of big Kaggle competitions that use DNNs. When I look at the architectures they use, it feels completely arbitrary! *This block over here, that block over there! Those two layers have a skip connection! Why?!*

(Below is my opinion of what ML looks like to an outsider who doesn't have inside information - it is most likely incorrect.)

---

On Kaggle, you can get multiple DNN solutions using completely different architectures with varying degrees of complexity - all achieving identical performance.

You'll have a ""Ensemble of 27 63-layer DNN with skip connections and other arbitrary complexity"" that slightly underperforms to ""Simple Autoencoder attached to a simple MLP"". For any NLP competition, you'll have some team that literally downloaded all pre-trained models named ""*bert*"" and used an ensemble of them, and perform identically to someone who did something entirely different.

*If you took the top 20 unique solutions for some competition and polled experts on which ones should perform better - how well would that correlate with actual performance?*

---

Academic papers are similarly confusing. Some papers often feel like authors just threw things at the wall until they found SOTA and then their brains promptly stopped functioning. It's rare to find authors who sincerely try to poke holes in their SOTA result. ML Papers often feel like a ""Dude Perfect"" video with one ""perfect take"" where the authors pretend they totally didn't spend 7 weeks getting failed takes.

The absence of information on what failed makes it very difficult to determine the value of what didn't fail (like undergrads who pester grad students about ""how to get into grad school"" - they don't know, man).

Now, at least in my field (and I'll admit physics is obviously a lot more rigorous than ML is), you do pick up a lot of intuition just by mingling with at conferences - you hear the ""unpublished"" information and develop intuition.

So, I ask you - the experts: Is DNN architecture just alchemy, where people are arbitrarily trying things until they work without knowing why? Or is there a method to this madness? 

*Given a problem statement and dataset, can you ""theory-craft"" an ML system that will at least hit the dart board, if not the bulls-eye on the first try? Can you, a priori, guess which hyperparameters will matter and which ones won't?*

lbr2fb,datascience,1612368867.0,"I was chatting with someone here in the sub about LinkedIn, and it made me realize something that I don't think gets discussed in enough detail when talking about job searches: ""networking"".

Most people will (correctly) tell you that networking is the best way to find a job. What most people don't tell you is that not all networking is the same, and not all networking is useful.

For example, I've had at least 1 or 2 fresh grads send me connection requests on LinkedIn asking me for a job for the last like 4 years. Most of the time I'm nice, I accept their request and tell them I unfortunately can't help them.

Technically speaking, these people have ""grown"" their network. Practically speaking, they have not *because there is no actual relationship there*. That is, unless you can create a point of contact *and then use it to create a relationship*, then that is not a real connection. 

So going on LinkedIn and shooting off random connection requests to a bunch of people you don't know and then asking them for jobs isn't going to help you. It's like a 0.001% chance of it having any impact in your job search.

Let's pause for a second and touch on an important topic while we're here: what is the goal of networking when you're looking for a job? It's not ""to get a job"". I want to make this clear: a connection isn't likely going to get you a job. They aren't even likely to get you an interview. The only thing that you should be expecting from a connection is that instead of your resume comingling with the 100s or 1000s of resumes submitted for a role you're interested in, that your resume will be almost surely one of the ones that gets looked at closely. That's it. After that, it's all you - you need to make sure your resume is spectacular, you need to interview well, etc. 

Yes, every once in a while you'll hit a home run and have someone in your network that is literally the hiring manager for a role you want (or has a real close relationship with someone in your network) and then you may be able to jump to the front of the line and go straight to an interview. But that is extremely rare.

Ok back to the original question: how do you network? I would say there are three things you need to focus on:

1. Strengthening/exploring your existing network of real connections (not fake social media ones): family, friends, classmates, professors, etc. People that you actually know and who, in turn, would have at least some predisposition to do nice things for you if you asked them to. If you're in the job market, the first thing you should do is reach out to people in this bubble that may have connections to the industry - and even if you don't think they do, ask. 
2. Finding 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn and having your common connection broker a conversation *that has a purpose*. A 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn is someone who shares a connection with you. So, say you're interested in a job at Company X, and you find that your college roommate is connected to Anne, a recruiter for Company X. You then ask your roommate ""hey, do you know Anne personally? If so, would you mind introducing me to her - I am very interested in their company and would like to see if I could be a good fit for a specific role they have. Also, if you can say some nice things about me that would be cool"". Or if you find a Data Analyst in a company you're interested in that is a common connection with a guy you had a class with, same thing ""Hey Bob, I see that Janet works at a company I'm interested in. If you know her personally, would you be willing to broker a conversation between the two of us? I'd like to get her opinion on whether I am qualified for X job at her company"".
3. Connecting with people with whom you share common interests that are somewhat specific. Say you like building models for fantasy football. There is a community out there of such people, and given that you already have something in common it is very reasonable to say something like ""hey, I see you too like fantasy football analytics. I have been working on this model that does x, y, z and could really use some feedback - and it looks like you've done similar stuff in the past"". If I am this other person, I am 10X more likely to reply to that and engage than I am to ""will you be my connection? I need a job"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lbr2fb/networking_its_not_just_linkedin_connections/,Networking - it's not just LinkedIn connections,,486,76,0.97

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

 
Mathematics for Data Science & Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fn9414/free_mathematics_courses_for_data_science_machine/,Free Mathematics Courses for Data Science & Machine Learning,Education,489,21,0.97

* **Kaggle still dominant** with the most prize money, most competitions, and most entries per competition...
* ... but there are **10+ other platforms** with interesting competitions and decent prize money, and dozens of single-competition sites
* **Almost all competition winners used Python**, 1 used C++, 1 used R, 1 used Java
* **96% (!) of Deep Learning solutions used PyTorch** (up from 77% last year)
* **All winning NLP solutions we found used Transformers**
* **Most computer vision solutions used CNNs**, though some used Transformer-based models
* **Tabular data competitions were mostly won by GBDTs** (gradient-boosted decision trees; mostly LightGBM), though ensembles with PyTorch are common
* **Some winners spent hundreds of dollars on cloud compute** for a single training run, **others managed to win just using Colab**'s free tier
* Winners have largely converged on a common toolkit - PyData stack for the basics, PyTorch for deep learning, LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost for GBDTs, Optuna for hyperparam optimisation.
* Half of competition winners are first-time winners; a third have won multiple comps before; half are solo winners. Some *serial winners* won 2-3 competitions just in 2022!

I strongly believe that the point of conducting research of any form is to contribute to the greater body of knowledge and ultimately benefit the human race and the world we live in. Not making your code public is, in my opinion, a hindrance to this progression and should be discouraged.

I've heard arguments along the lines of ""but what if I want to patent the code and make a living?""

Honestly though, I'm a bit baffled at how reviewers would let papers through if the code isn't public in the first place.

This week’s US rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a major milestone, a true triumph for scientists, and a massive relief for the rest of us. But it’s also an excuse to revisit my least favorite paper published this year.

That paper, “[Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/papers/Replicability-PNAS-2020.pdf),” was written by a team of researchers at Northwestern led by Brian Uzzi. It was published in PNAS on May 4, and its publication was accompanied by a glowing press release (“[AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/ai-tool-speeds-up-search-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines/?fj=1)”) and received credulous coverage in outlets like [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/artificial-intelligence-reproducibility-crisis-kellogg/) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/northwestern-university-team-develops-tool-to-rate-covid-19-research-11589275800).

One of my primary professional interests is using data analysis to systematically identify good science, so I was eager to dig into the paper. Unfortunately, I found that the paper is flawed and doesn’t support the Covid-related story that the authors and Northwestern shared with the media. My initial skepticism has proved out; vaccines are now being distributed with (as far as I can tell) no help whatsoever from this particular bit of AI. Closer analysis will show that the paper isn’t convincing, that it had nothing to do with Covid, and that the author was reckless in how he promoted it.

**Problem #1: The machine learning in the academic paper is flawed**

The core of the paper is a machine learning model built by the authors that predicts whether or not a paper will replicate. To be technical about it, the model is trained on a dataset of 96 social science papers, 59 of which (61.4%) failed to replicate. The model takes the full text of the paper as an input, uses word embeddings and TF-IDF to convert each text to a 400-dimensional vector, and then feeds those vectors into an ensemble logistic regression/random forest model. The cross-validated results show an average accuracy of 0.69 across runs compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.614. These are all standard techniques, but skilled machine learning practitioners are already raising their eyebrows about three points:

* **The authors don’t have enough data to build a reliable model**. The authors have used just 96 examples to build a model with 400 input variables. As mentioned above, the model has two components: a logistic regressor and a random forest. A conventional rule of thumb is that logistic regression requires a minimum of 10 examples per variable, which would suggest that the authors need 40x more data. “Underdetermined” doesn’t even begin to describe the situation.The data needs of random forests are harder to characterize. While geneticists [routinely use random forests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154091/) in settings with more variables than examples, their use case is typically more focused on determining variable importance than actually making predictions. And indeed, [some research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25532820/) that random forests need more than 200 examples per variable, or almost 1000x more data than the authors have.**The bottom line is that you can’t build a reliable machine learning model on just 96 papers.**
* **The model structure is too complicated**. Model structure is the garden of forking paths for machine learning. Adjustments to a model can improve its performance on available data while reducing performance on unseen data. (And no, cross-validation alone doesn’t fix this!) The model structure the authors describe is reasonable enough, but it also includes some clearly arbitrary choices like using both logistic regression and random forests (rather than just picking one) or aggregating word vectors using both simple averaging and TF-IDF (again rather than just picking one.) With just 96 examples in the dataset, each version of model that the authors tried had a real chance to show a cross-validation accuracy that looked like success despite arising from chance. In context, **trying multiple model architectures is the the equivalent of performing subgroup analyses.**
* **The effect size is too small.** Increasing accuracy from the baseline of 0.614 to 0.69 is too small an effect to achieve statistical significance particularly in light of the small sample size. The large number of degrees of freedom in model design. The paper’s statistical analyses generate pleasing p-values (*p<0.001*) demonstrating that the model is effective *on this particular set of papers.* But what we’re actually interested in is whether the model outperforms the baseline on unseen data (i.e. whether it has better generalization error.) Performing [inference about generalization error](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024068626366) is a [challenging task](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790639) (and there isn’t a single agreed upon methodology). But as a sanity check, consider the t-test we would use to e.g. determine if one diagnostic test were more accurate than another when given to patients. The cynical baseline (predicting that nothing ever replicates) gives an accuracy of 0.614 on these 96 papers. The authors’ model achieves an accuracy of 0.69 on those same papers. That gives a one-tailed p-value of 0.134 — a delightful value for a paper that is itself about replicability. And this point isn't just pedantry; I'm genuinely unsure if the model will actually outperform the cynical baseline on unseen data. I don't know what the base rate for replication is in the test sets. I did track down the replication status for one set (Row 2 in the paper) and saw  7 out of the 8 results in that set failed to replicate, so our cynical baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.875 — outperforming the “AI” model significantly on this admittedly small set.

Let me be very clear: These are very fundamental problems. After reviewing the paper, I’m not confident that their machine learning model adds any value at all. It reflects poorly on PNAS that this paper made it through peer review. Unfortunately, general scientific journals - no matter how prestigious - don’t seem equipped to effectively review papers involving machine learning; Nature’s infamous paper on predicting earthquakes with deep learning was [widely criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/c4ylga/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals/) in the machine learning community.

**Problem #2: The paper has nothing to do with Covid**

Let’s set aside every issue I’ve raised to this point and accept that the authors really can identify social science papers that are less likely to replicate. That still doesn’t make it relevant to Covid.

Their entire system is premised on picking up subtle linguistic markers that supposedly indicate when a researcher (perhaps subconsciously) believes she’s performing sub-par science. Uzzi compares the approach to reading body language.

But there’s no reason to believe that the linguistic “body language” of psychologists tells us anything about the body language of Covid-19 researchers. Psychology and virology are very different fields with different conventions even in normal times. The pandemic itself has undoubtedly impacted word choices, as papers written under extreme time pressure by researchers from around the world get shared to pre-print servers rather than being polished and published in journals. At a minimum, the model would have to be significantly adjusted to be applied to Covid research.

**Problem #3: Northwestern and Brian Uzzi crossed the line promoting this paper**

Self-promotion is a natural and even important part of science; good research doesn’t always get the attention is deserves. And certainly the decade-long AI boom has been driven forward by rosy projections about what AI can accomplish. But the paper’s lead author, Brian Uzzi, went too far in his efforts to promote it.

The paper was published just two months into the pandemic at a time when the trauma felt more acute than chronic. The uncertainty and fear fueled a desperation for anything that might end the ordeal. In that environment, putting out a press release entitled “AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines” takes on a moral dimension.

The scientists and trial participants who brought us a vaccine in record time are heroes. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal coverage of this paper now has a correction appended:

>Northwestern University researchers will make an artificial-intelligence tool designed to rate the promise of scientific papers on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments available when testing is completed. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the tool would be available later this year.

Indeed.

dp389c,MachineLearning,1572419093.0,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if anyone else have similar feelings with regards to a number of accepted papers coming from Chinese universities/authors presented in ICCV. Thus far in the conference, I came across quite a lot of papers with questionable motives which made me question the ethical consequences.

These papers are, for the most part, concerned with various forms of person identification (i.e., typical big brother stuff). In fact, when you look at the accepted papers, more than 80% of any kind of identification papers have Chinese authors/affiliations.

But that's not all, some papers go to extreme lengths of person re-identification such as:

1- Occluded person re- identification (i.e., person re-identification through mask/glass)

2- Person re-identification in low-light environments

3- Cross domain person re-identification

4- Cross dataset person re-identification

5- Cross modality person re-identification

6- Unsupervised person re-identification

&#x200B;

And maybe you think person re-identification is all there is, but its not. There are also:

1- Vehicle identification, vehicle re-identification, vehicle re-identification from aerial images

2- Occluded vehicle recovery

3- Lip reading from video sequences

4- Crowd counting in scenes, crowd density prediction, and crowd counting in aerial pictures (in fact, all but one crowd counting papers are China affiliated)

&#x200B;

I wonder whether I am being overly sensitive due to recent influx of news about Uighurs in China and Hong Kong protests etc. or if these papers are basically funded by the Chinese government (or its extensions) for some big brother stuff.

What is your opinion on the research on these subjects which can be used for some ethically questionable applications getting published in top conferences?

&#x200B;

Edit: I should mention that I did not mean to offend any Chinese researchers and I am of course aware that many great inventions in recent ML/DL research that we use came from Chinese researchers. What I stated above is merely my observation while passing by the posters in the conference.

Note that this is related to the work in the *Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning for Negotiation Dialogues* paper. On it's own, it is interesting work.

While the article from Independent seems to be the only one that finally gives the clarification *'The company chose to shut down the chats because ""our interest was having bots who could talk to people""'*, **ALL** the articles say things that suggest that researchers went into panic mode, had to 'pull the plug' out of fear, this stuff is scary. One of the articles (don't remember which) even went on to say something like *'A week after Elon Musk suggested AI needs to be regulated and Mark Zuckerberg disagreed, Facebook had to shut down it's AI because it became too dangerous/scary'* (or something to this effect).

While I understand the hype around deep learning (a.k.a backpropaganda), etc., I think these articles are so ridiculous. I wouldn't even call this hype, but almost 'fake news'. I understand that sometimes articles should try to make the news more interesting/appealing by hyping it a bit, but this is almost detrimental, and is just promoting AI fear-mongering.

My job is all politics. I’m pulled every which way. I’m constantly interrupted whenever I try to share any ideas. My work is often tossed out. And if I have a good idea, it’s ignored until someone else presents the same idea, then everyone loves it. I’m constantly asked by non-technical people to do things that are incorrect, and when I try to speak up, I’m ignored and my manager doesn’t defend me either. I was promised technical work but I’m stuck working out of excel and PowerPoint while I desperately try to maintain my coding and modeling skills outside of work. 

I’m a woman of color working in a conservative field. I’m exhausted. Is this normal? Do I need to find another field? Are there companies/ types of companies that you recommend I look into that aren’t like this? This isn’t what I thought data science would be.

EDIT: Thank you for the responses everyone! I’ve reached out to some of you privately and will try to respond to everyone else. Based on the comments and some of the suggestions (which were helpful, but already tried), I think it’s time to plan an exit strategy. Being in this environment has led to burnout and mental/physical health is more important than a job. 

To those of you suggesting this as an opportunity to develop soft skills or work on my excel/ppt skills, that’s actually exactly how I pitched it to myself when I first started this role and realized it wouldn’t be as technical as I’d like. But being in an environment like this has actually been detrimental to my soft skills. I’ve lost all confidence in my ability to speak in front of others. And my deck designs are constantly tossed out even after spending hours trying to make them as nice as possible. To anyone else reading this that is experiencing this, you deserve better. You do not have to put up with this in the name of resilience. At a certain point, you are just ramming yourself into a wall over and over again. Others in my organization were getting to work on data science work, so it wasn’t a bait and switch for everyone. Just some of us (coincidentally, all women).

The announcement is from the Starcraft 2 official page. AlphaStar will play as an anonymous player against some ladder players who opt in in this experiment in the European game servers.

Some highlights:

* AlphaStar can play anonymously as and against the three different races of the game: Protoss, Terran and Zerg in 1vs1 matches, in a non-disclosed future date. Their intention is that players treat AlphaStar as any other player.
* Replays will be used to publish a peer-reviewer paper.
* They restricted this version of AlphaStar to only interact with the information it gets from the game camera (I assume that this includes the minimap, and not the API from the January version?).
* They also increased the restrictions of AlphaStar actions-per-minute (APM), according to pro players advice. There is no additional info in the blog about how this restriction is taking place.

Personally, I see this as a very interesting experiment, although I'll like to know more details about the new restrictions that AlphaStar will be using, because as it was discussed here in January, such restrictions can be unfair to human players.

History tends to repeat itself. But FB-Prophet's [tainted memory](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/syx41w/p_beware_of_false_fbprophets_introducing_the/) is too recent and should act as a warning not to repeat the same mistakes.

This post compares Neural-Prophet's performance with Exponential Smoothing (ETS), a half-century-old forecasting method part of every practitioner's toolkit.

Our [comparison](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/blob/main/experiments/neuralprophet/README.md) covers Tourism, M3, M4, ERCOT, and ETTm2 datasets, following the authors' recommended hyperparameter and network configuration settings. Despite Neural-Prophet's [outstanding success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15397) over its unreliable predecessor, its errors are still 30 percent larger than ETS' while doubling its computation time.

Would something like the ACL 2020 best paper, [Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.442/), help if applied to CV? Considering the wide variety of lighting, camera angles, background etc for image classification, would behavioral tests actually reduce these issues? Are there other potential solutions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/phjecd/n_facebook_apologizes_after_ai_puts_primates/,[N] Facebook Apologizes After A.I.

mdlnvy,datascience,1616754558.0,"**WARNING:** rant coming

I want to to share my unfortunate experience with Zindi platform. It is a data science competition platform, same as kaggle, but the bounty doesn't usually exceed 2000$, and it is geared more toward African countries.

I participated in a competition there hoping that the company hosting it would hire me if I win. After few weeks I snatched the second place on the leaderboard. I kept slightly improving it for the span of of what's left on the competition. Then, one week before the deadline, I got my account banned.

I opened my email thinking it was some sort of a mistake, I found an email sent by them stating that they banned me under the pretext of ""Collaboration outside of team"". I responded explaining to them that I single handedly worked on the solution of my problem, telling them I'm ready to provide proof if they want. They didn't respond.

Then today, out of sheer luck, I discovered that the team that took my place on the leaderboard when I got banned work as a data scientist for Zindi, which is quite preposterous to say the least.

How can they work in the company and be allowed to participate? Meaning it's in his advantage to ban people who are topping the leaderboard: they eliminate any competition, and they get the money. This explains the very empty, devoid of any logic explanation provided by Zindi as the reason on why they banned me, the such of ""Collaboration outside of team"", without the willingness to elaborate any further, or give sufficient proof, even if my solution out-performs theirs.

It's just insane. I would say stay out of Zindi, it is an unfair community, chances are not equal, and they are not professional. Zindi epitomizes everything wrong with African countries, conflict of interest, lack of respect to people, rentier state, and corruption (ps: I come from an African country).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mdlnvy/everything_wrong_with_zindi_data_science/,Everything wrong with Zindi data science competition platform.,Discussion,474,30,0.99
hbzd5o,MachineLearning,1592567690.0,"The deadline for submitting papers to the NeurIPS 2020 conference was two weeks ago. Since then, almost everyday I come across long Twitter threads from ML researchers that publicly advertise their work (obviously NeurIPS submissions, from the template and date of the shared arXiv preprint). They are often quite famous researchers from Google, Facebook... with thousands of followers and therefore a high visibility on Twitter. These posts often get a lot of likes and retweets - see examples in comment.

While I am glad to discover new exciting works, I am also concerned by the impact of such practice on the review process. I know that submissions of arXiv preprints are not forbidden by NeurIPS, but this kind of very engaging public advertising brings the anonymity violation to another level.

Besides harming the double-blind review process, I am concerned by the social pressure it puts on reviewers. It is definitely harder to reject or even criticise a work that already received praise across the community through such advertising, especially when it comes from the account of a famous researcher or a famous institution.

However, in recent Twitter discussions associated to these threads, I failed to find people caring about these aspects, notably among top researchers reacting to the posts. Would you also say that this is fine (as, anyway, we cannot really assume that a review is double-blind when arXiv public preprints with authors names and affiliations are allowed)?

We're excited to release Composer ([https://github.com/mosaicml/composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer)), an open-source library to speed up training of deep learning models by integrating better algorithms into the training process!

[Time and cost reductions across multiple model families](https://preview.redd.it/0y54ykj8qrn81.png?width=3009&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbac48971471e180913b867c84318a9e9c60dc90)

Composer lets you train:

* A ResNet-101 to 78.1% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 30 minutes ($49 on AWS), **3.5x faster and 71% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A ResNet-50 to 76.51% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 14 minutes ($40 on AWS), **2.9x faster and 65% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A GPT-2 to a perplexity of 24.11 on OpenWebText in 4 hours and 27 minutes ($145 on AWS), **1.7x faster and 43% cheaper than the baseline.**

Composer features a **functional interface** (similar to `torch.nn.functional`), which you can integrate into your own training loop, and a **trainer,** which handles seamless integration of efficient training algorithms into the training loop for you.

**Industry practitioners:** leverage our 20+ vetted and well-engineered implementations of speed-up algorithms to easily reduce time and costs to train models. Composer's built-in trainer makes it easy to **add multiple efficient training algorithms in a single line of code.** Trying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list, and [we provide training recipes](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer#resnet-101) that yield the best training efficiency for popular benchmarks such as ResNets and GPTs.

**ML scientists:** use our two-way callback system in the Trainer **to easily prototype algorithms for wall-clock training efficiency.**[ Composer features tuned baselines to use in your research](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/tree/dev/composer/yamls), and the software infrastructure to help study the impacts of an algorithm on training dynamics. Many of us wish we had this for our previous research projects!

myurtx,datascience,1619433632.0,"In my \~6 years of working in the analytics domain, for most of the Fortune 10 clients, across geographies, one thing I've realized is while people may solve business problems using analytics, the journey is lost somewhere. At the risk of sounding cliche, ***'Enjoy the journey, not the destination"".*** So here's my attempt at creating the problem-solving journey from what I've experienced/learned/failed at.

The framework for problem-solving using analytics is a 3 step process. On we go:

1. **Break the business problem into an analytical problem**  
Let's start this with another cliche - *"" If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"".* This is where a lot of analysts/consultants fail. As soon as a business problem falls into their ears, they straightaway get down to solution-ing, without even a bare attempt at understanding the problem at hand. To tackle this, I (and my team) follow what we call the **CS-FS framework** (extra marks to those who can come up with a better naming).  
The CS-FS framework stands for the Current State - Future State framework.In the CS-FS framework, the first step is to identify the **Current State** of the client, where they're at currently with the problem, followed by the next step, which is to identify the **Desired Future State**, where they want to be after the solution is provided - the insights, the behaviors driven by the insight and finally the outcome driven by the behavior.  
The final, and the most important step of the CS-FS framework is **to identify the gap**, that prevents the client from moving from the Current State to the Desired Future State. This becomes your Analytical Problem, and thus the input for the next step
2. **Find the Analytical Solution to the Analytical Problem**  
Now that you have the business problem converted to an analytical problem, let's look at the data, shall we? \*\*A BIG NO!\*\*  
We will start forming hypotheses around the problem, **WITHOUT BEING BIASED BY THE DATA.** I can't stress this point enough. The process of forming hypotheses should be independent of what data you have available. The correct method to this is after forming all possible hypotheses, you should be looking at the available data, and eliminating those hypotheses for which you don't have data.  
After the hypotheses are formed, you start looking at the data, and then the usual analytical solution follows - understand the data, do some EDA, test for hypotheses, do some ML (if the problem requires it), and yada yada yada. This is the part which most analysts are good at. For example - if the problem revolves around customer churn, this is the step where you'll go ahead with your classification modeling.Let me remind you, the output for this step is just an analytical solution - a classification model for your customer churn problem.   
Most of the time, the people for whom you're solving the problem would not be technically gifted, so they won't understand the Confusion Matrix output of a classification model or the output of an AUC ROC curve. They want you to talk in a language they understand. This is where we take the final road in our journey of problem-solving - the final step
3. **Convert the Analytical Solution to a Business Solution**  
An analytical solution is for computers, a business solution is for humans. And more or less, you'll be dealing with humans who want to understand what your many weeks' worth of effort has produced. You may have just created the most efficient and accurate ML model the world has ever seen, but if the final stakeholder is unable to interpret its meaning, then the whole exercise was useless.  
This is where you will use all your story-boarding experience to actually tell them a story that would start from the current state of their problem to the steps you have taken for them to reach the desired future state. This is where visualization skills, dashboard creation, insight generation, creation of decks come into the picture. Again, when you create dashboards or reports, keep in mind that you're telling a story, and not just laying down a beautiful colored chart on a Power BI or a Tableau dashboard. Each chart, each number on a report should be action-oriented, and part of a larger story.  
Only when someone understands your story, are they most likely going to purchase another book from you. Only when you make the journey beautiful and meaningful for your fellow passengers and stakeholders, will they travel with you again.

With that said, I've reached my destination. I hope you all do too. I'm totally open to criticism/suggestions/improvements that I can make to this journey.

l2q3hh,MachineLearning,1611329723.0,"I'm slightly new to the field of ML research (have 1 published conference paper and 2 journal papers under review), but from what I've seen so far, a vast majority of the papers in the field are just Permutations and Combinations of the same existing datasets and existing methods. When I worked with a research group on computational biology, most of the work there was something along the lines of: taking a biology dataset that had only statistical analysis done before, training a random ML/deep learning network, and publishing that as a ""novel"" contribution - low hanging fruit like that is everywhere from astronomy to healthcare. I've seen my friends trying 100s of different models on a dataset just to see if any one model or an ensemble of some of those models would beat the existing SOTA by even 0.5%. On popular datasets like the NSLKDD (an intrusion detection dataset), we have 100s of neural network models, each of which is a paper - even though all of them have more or less the same performance (some are better in accuracy, other have lower FPR, other have lesser training cost, or others are just ensembles). 

Sure, there are very interesting and novel ideas coming in - but the vast majority of people just seem to be throwing random models from random fields at random datasets hoping that it's faster/better/less memory usage/anything that can be used to claim ""novelty"".

10m6kpq,datascience,1674777528.0,"So I have just wrapped up first round interviews for an open position on my team. I work in banking and most of my career involves building regression or logistic regression models.

One of the trends I've seen since the tech data science boom started is that there just seems to be a drop in the technical level for peoples with masters degree on fundamentals. It seems too many candidates with masters degrees  do not understand mathematical assumptions of most of the models they are using even at a conceptual level.   For example, during the interview I asked most candidates about regression and what assumptions are required.

Nearly every single masters level candidate didn't know why the specific assumptions were made (even if they could correctly list them), could not answer questions on what happens when you violate an assumption, and did not know how to test violation of those assumptions or how to address those issues. Whats disconcerting is these are candidates coming out of professional masters programs from the worlds leading universities and most of them will end up in jobs where modeling error can have multi-million dollar impacts.

For some additional context: The comment here is explicitly here about standard of candidates I interviewed for people with masters degrees. Most of the Ph.D jobs met standards we expect, even though the job does not require one. The job is one that is very specifically related to regression modeling, time series.   


Some clarification: This isn't not having trouble finding candidates post. This is a role at a industry leading firm, and there is no shortage of good candidates.  What I am specifically addressing in this posts is that candidates we are interviewing with masters degrees don't know text book stuff they should know based on whats listed in their resume.

play in the real world problems you guys solve, and how the fundamentals like those mean so much more than just prerequisites for upper level courses. From what I’ve read, it seems like the most important topics i should be an expert on is:

Probability theory (probability distributions, how they are used to model real life phenomena, and their relations to each other)

Statistical Inference &amp; hypothesis testing (being able to quantify uncertainty and interpret results from tests, knowing about properties of estimators, p values and inference in the Bayesian context)

# ICLR2020 as a Fully Virtual Conference

Due to growing concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, instead shifting to a fully virtual conference. We were very excited to hold ICLR in Addis Ababa, and it is disappointing that we will not all be able to come together in person in April. This unfortunate event does give us the opportunity to innovate on how to host an effective remote conference. The organizing committees are now working to create a virtual conference that will be valuable and engaging for both presenters and attendees. 

Immediate guidance for authors, and questions about registration and participation are given below. We are actively discussing several options, with full details to be announced soon. 

## Information for Authors of Accepted Papers

All accepted papers at the virtual conference will be presented using a pre-recorded video. 

All accepted papers (poster, spotlight, long talk) will need to create a 5 minute video that will be used during the virtual poster session.

In addition, papers accepted as a long-talk should create a 15 minute video.

We will provide more detailed instructions soon, particularly on how to record your presentations. In the interim, please do begin preparing your talk and associated slides. 

Each video should use a set of slides, and should be timed carefully to not exceed the time allocation. The slides should be in widescreen format (16:9), and can be created in any presentation software that allows you to export to PDF (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, Beamer, etc). 

## Virtual Conference Dates

The conference will still take place between April 25 and April 30, as these are the dates people have allocated to attend the conference. We expect most participants will still commit their time during this window to participate in the conference, and have discussions with fellow researchers around the world. 

## Conference Registration Fee

The registration fee will be substantially reduced to 50 USD for students and 100 USD for non-students. For those who have already registered, we will automatically refund the remainder of the registration fee, so that you only pay this new reduced rate. Registration provides each participant with an access code to participate in sessions where they can ask questions of speakers, see questions and answers from other participants, take part in discussion groups, meet with sponsors, and join groups for networking. Registration furthermore supports the infrastructure needed to host and support the virtual conference. 

## Registration Support 

There will be funding available for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to get registration reimbursed, with similar conditions to the Travel Support Application. If you have already applied for and received a travel grant for ICLR 2020, you will get free registration for ICLR 2020. The Travel Application on the website will be updated soon, to accept applications for free registration, with the deadline extended to April 10, 2020. 

## Workshops

We will send details for workshops through the workshop organisers soon, but it is expected that these will follow a similar virtual format to the main conference.

uakf25,datascience,1650766086.0,"So I was just zombie scrolling LinkedIn and a colleague reshared a post by a LinkedIn influencer (yeah yeah I know, why am I bothering...) and it went something like this:

> People use this image <insert mocking meme here> to explain doing machine learning (or data science) without statistics or math.

>Don't get discouraged by it. There's always people wanting to feel superior and the need to advertise it. You don't need to know math or statistics to do #datascience or #machinelearning. Does it help? Yes of course. Just like knowing C can help you understand programming languages but isn't a requirement to build applications with #Python

Now, the bit that concerned me was several hundred people commented along the lines of ""yes, thank you influencer I've been put down by maths/stats people before, you've encouraged me to continue my journey as a data scientist"".  

For the record, we can argue what is meant by a 'data science' job (as 90% of most consist mainly of requirements gathering and data wrangling) or where and how you apply machine learning. But I'm specifically referencing a job where a significant amount of time is spent building a detailed statistical/ML model. 
 
Like, my gut feeling is to shoutout ""this is wrong"" but it's got me wondering, is there any truth to this standpoint? I feel like ultimately it's a loaded question and it depends on the specifics for each of the tonnes of stat/ML modelling roles out there. Put more generally: On one hand, a lot of the actual maths is abstracted away by packages and a decent chunk of the application of inferential stats boils down to heuristic checks of test results. But I mean, on the other hand, how competently can you *analyse* those results if you decide that you're not going to invest in the maths/stats theory as part of your skillset? 

I feel like if I were to interview a candidate that wasn't comfortable with the mats/stats theory I wouldn't be confident in their abilities to build effective models within my team. *You're trying to build a career in mathematical/statistical modelling without having learnt or wanting to learn about the mathematical or statistical models themselves?* is a summary of how I'm feeling about this.

jgwqe8,MachineLearning,1603490190.0,"*Aside from the clickbait title, I am earnestly looking for some advice and discussion from people who are actually employed. That being said, here's my gripe:*

I have been relentlessly inundated by the words ""AI, ML, Big Data"" throughout my undergrad from other CS majors, business and sales oriented people, media, and <insert-catchy-name>.ai type startups. It seems like everyone was peddling ML as the go to solution, the big money earner, and the future of the field. I've heard college freshman ask stuff like, ""if I want to do CS, am I going to need to learn ML to be relevant"" - if you're on this sub, I probably do not need to continue to elaborate on just how ridiculous the ML craze is.  Every single university has opened up ML departments or programs and are pumping out ML graduates at an unprecedented rate. **Surely, there'd be a job market to meet the incredible supply of graduates and cultural interest?**

Swept up in a mixture of genuine interest and hype, I decided to pursue computer vision. I majored in Math-CS at a [top-10](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all) CS university (based on at least one arbitrary ranking). I had three computer vision internships, two at startups, one at NASA JPL, in each doing non-trivial CV work; I (re)implemented and integrated CV systems from mixtures of recently published papers. I have a bunch of projects showing both CV and CS fundamentals (OS, networking, data structures, algorithms, etc) knowledge. I have taken graduate level ML coursework. I was accepted to Carnegie Mellon for an MS in Computer Vision, but I deferred to 2021 - all in all, I worked my ass off to try to simultaneously get a solid background in math AND computer science AND computer vision.

That brings me to where I am now, which is unemployed and looking for jobs. Almost every single position I have seen requires a PhD and/or 5+ years of experience, and whatever I have applied for has ghosted me so far. The notion that ML is a high paying in-demand field seems to only be true if your name is Andrej Karpathy - and I'm only sort of joking. It seems like unless you have a PhD from one of the big 4 in CS and multiple publications in top tier journals you're out of luck, or at least vying for one of the few remaining positions at small companies.

This seems normalized in ML, but this is not the case for quite literally every other subfield or even generalized CS positions. Getting a high paying job at a Big N company is possible as a new grad with just a bachelors and general SWE knowledge, and there are a plethora of positions elsewhere. Getting the equivalent with basically every specialization, whether operating systems, distributed systems, security, networking, etc, is also possible, and doesn't require 5 CVPR publications.

**TL;DR** **From my personal perspective,** **if you want to do ML because of career prospects, salaries, or job security, pick almost any other CS specialization**. In ML, you'll find yourself working 2x as hard through difficult theory and math to find yourself competing with more applicants for fewer positions.

I am absolutely complaining and would love to hear a more positive perspective, but in the meanwhile I'll be applying to jobs, working on more post-grad projects, and contemplating switching fields.

fhveru,MachineLearning,1584081487.0,"I was trying to read about Natural Gradient Descent today, and found the Wikipedia section[1] to read just like an ad for a different technique[2]. I thought to myself that surely it must be a big deal to be in the Wikipedia article of SGD alongside RMSProp and Adam, but it turned out to be a paper for 2015 with 21 citations (not that citations are the measure of good science, but the maximally optimistic light would still be that it would be too early to include that along the canonical optimization algorithms of the field).

This seemed fishy to me so I did some digging. It was added to the Wikipedia article on Febuary 2017 [3], which at the time, the paper appears to have had 0 citations[4], by user Vp314 [5] on Wikipedia, which also happened to be the author's gmail username [6]. Furthermore the only edits that user has done on Wikipedia are related to adding their technique to the Wikipedia page on SGD [5]: one to add the original section[7], one to make a minor correction, and one to re-add that section[8] (in April 2018) after it was deleted with the comment ""Removed a recent extension which has been hardly cited by anyone in the academic community. Its appearance in Wikipedia made it look like an established technique, which is not"" [9].

My instincts are what this person has done is wrong and taking advantage of Wikipedia, but I would love to hear some other perspectives (and maybe get a little less angry). Is there a defensible reason to do so?

The **original Keras** was just a high-level API specification for machine learning, which was really nice when collaborating with people who have less engineering background. The API was framework agnostic and the main implementation supported multiple backends (Teano, Tensorflow, and MS-CNTK)

Essentially, the API design resembled the abstractions of modern high-level frameworks such as PyTorch-Lightning and fast.ai, with slightly different *design* *flavors* (e.g., a Keras model combines the network with the metrics and training code in a single object, whereas other frameworks usually separate the network from the learner object).

The huge advantage of keras was that it was available and the API stable **back in 2016, 2017.** I think this is something remarkable in a field that moves so fast.

But then, you know the story, Google announced its plans to incorporated it into Tensorflow 2. This wouldn't have been a problem on its own, but it slowly killed keras for 3 reasons:

1. During the time-span of this merge, the keras API was effectively ""frozen"", making it lag behind alternatives in terms of features
2. The release of TF2 came too late. On top of that, the first versions were buggy and even now are lacking some basic features.
3. Instead of making a hard cut between TF 1 and 2, Google decided that it's better to carried over a lot of baggage and crap from TF1, making the framework extremely bloated. When something does not work, you get overwhelmed by long cryptic error messages and stacktraces longer than your screen can visualize.

So, this post is really intended as a **funeral for the keras API**.

Looking forward to know your thoughts.

Far from it, I really like their impressive contributions to ML (Colab, TPU, JAX, ...), but the story with keras and TF2 is really frustrating for me who liked working with it in the past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mhrpbm/d_keras_killed_by_google/,[D] Keras: Killed by Google,Discussion,468,63,0.89

Get everything out. When you’re flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You’ll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you’re overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it’s children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here’s an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don’t want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I’d still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can’t explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I’m taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it’s out I feel so relieved. 

I hope this helps, and if you have any

d9jidd,MachineLearning,1569503800.0,"HuggingFace has just released Transformers 2.0, a library for Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch which provides state-of-the-art pretrained models in most recent NLP architectures (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, RoBERTa, DistilBert, XLM...) comprising several multi-lingual models.

An interesting feature is that the library provides deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

You can move a full model seamlessly from one framework to the other during its lifetime (instead of just exporting a static computation graph at the end like with ONNX). This way it's possible to get the best of both worlds by selecting the best framework for each step of training, evaluation, production, e.g. train on TPUs before finetuning/testing in PyTorch and finally deploy with TF-X.

An [example in the readme](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#quick-tour-tf-20-training-and-pytorch-interoperability) shows how Bert can be finetuned on GLUE in a few lines of code with the high-level API `tf.keras.Model.fit()` and then loaded in PyTorch for quick and easy inspection and debugging.

As TensorFlow and PyTorch as getting closer, this kind of deep interoperability between both frameworks could become a new norm for multi-backends libraries.

jc1fp2,MachineLearning,1602815151.0,"**Abstract**

Optimization is at the core of modern deep learning. We propose AdaBelief optimizer to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability.

The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the ""belief"" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step.

We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

dw7sms,MachineLearning,1573727954.0,"Hello all,

I'm writing here to discuss a bit of a moral dilemma I'm having at work with a new project we got handed. Here it is in a nutshell : 

>Provide a tool that can gauge a person's personality just from an image of their face. This can then be used by an HR office to help out with sorting job applicants.

So first off, there is no concrete proof that this is even possible. I mean, I have a hard time believing that our personality is characterized by our facial features. [Lots of papers](http://alittlelab.com/littlelab/pubs/Little_07_personality_composites.pdf) claim this to be possible, but they don't give accuracies above 20%-25%. (And if you are detecting a person's personality using the big 5, this is simply random.) This branch of [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy) was discredited in the Middle Ages for crying out loud.

Second, if somehow there is a correlation, and we do develop this tool, I don't want to be anywhere near the training of this algorithm. What if we underrepresent some population class? What if our algorithm becomes racist/ sexist/ homophobic/ etc... The social implications of this kind of technology used in a recruiter's toolbox are huge.

Now the reassuring news is that the team I work with all have the same concerns as I do. The project is still in its State-of-the-Art phase, and we are hoping that it won't get past the Proof-of-Concept phase. Hell, my boss told me that it's a good way to ""empirically prove that this mumbo jumbo does not work.""

fmg41r,MachineLearning,1584802347.0,"First, this rant is not against people that really know their stuff, knowing the limits of ML and other approaches.

Too many people in the recent years looked at machine learning approaches as a sort of silver bullet solutions. The approach seems like: ""ah you build a neural network (or whatever other technique that sounds cool) and after a bit of time it should quickly find the solutions for your"". Then they proceed to mention deepmind achievements with alphazero, muzero, alphago, alphastar and so on.

Some months ago I read here, if I am not mistaken, a nice subthread in a discussion where some people pointed out that it all depends on how good the domain is modeled.  
If the domain is incomplete, inaccurate or wrong, the most effective machine learning techniques won't help. Some people, correctly, pointed out that one cannot boast ML methods if at the end the problem is not properly modeled.

The best example to me is the current pandemic. If those methods would be a that effective, we *could* expect quick solutions. Instead modeling the problem of a disease in a human body is so complex that good luck. Surely it will be eventually done, even if with good approximations, but to get the point - that the domain has to be properly simulated - into the most hyped people is really hard. And even when the simulation is proper, it is not granted that a good solution will be found.

That is really frustrating at times in a discussion.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Some of the common signs of imposter syndrome include ([reference](https://so06.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521/pdf)):

* Self-doubt
* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills
* Attributing your success to external factors
* Berating your performance
* Fear that you won’t live up to expectations
* Overachieving
* Sabotaging your own success
* Setting incredibly challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short

## WHAT IS IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[YouTube Video - The Imposter Syndrome](https://youtu.be/eqhUHyVpAwE)

Imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud. It disproportionately affects high-achieving people, who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments. Many Data Scientists question whether they are deserving of accolades, their job, recognition, or the like.

* You do not have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
* You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don’t have time to learn.
* You feel incompetent.

Why do so many Data Scientists have it?

Data Science is an extremely broad field of study. There are core competencies required to have a successful career in data science, but there is also a lot of industry specific and technical knowledge that is ever changing.  
Data Science is a career which has many job options, all of which require a high level of expertise and knowledge. If the broad, seemingly confused data science job postings show us anything, it is that many companies do not really understand what a data scientist is, how they compare to a data engineer or software engineer, and how to train or support them within an organization. To add to this, the labor market for data scientists in predominantly new graduated or early career professionals.

When challenge is high, and expectations are unknown it encourages people to fall into high arousal, anxiety, and worry. You can see this from psychologist’s [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) flow model.

These feelings are compounded by a lack of support, feedback, and mentorship provided within a company. This is not generally intentional but a product of small data science departments, business executives licking their wounds from years of poor data quality and technical deficit and increasing demand for better data driven outcomes.

## HOW CAN DATA SCIENTISTS DEAL WITH IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[According to the American Psychology Association](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud), If you recognize yourself in the description of the impostor phenomenon, take heart. There are ways to overcome the belief that you don’t measure up.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

* You are a generally competent person.
* There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you and that’s ok and expected. Even more importantly: you’re not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough, you’re going to find people that are better than you at everything you do and that’s ok.
* You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn’t be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals – generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else.

When the Imposter Syndrome feeling comes up:

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person – if you weren’t, you wouldn’t have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that’s graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the ‘drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them – that’s just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn’t diminish your value – it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn – and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

### TALK TO YOUR MENTORS.

“The thing that made so much of a difference was supportive, encouraging supervision”.

Many have benefited from sharing their feelings with a mentor who helped them recognize that their impostor feelings are both normal and irrational. Though many will often struggle with these feelings, you must be able to recognize personal or professional progress and growth instead of comparing myself to other students and professionals.

### RECOGNIZE YOUR EXPERTISE.

Don’t just look to those who are more experienced, more popular, or more successful for help. Tutoring or working with younger students, for instance, can help you realize how far you’ve come and how much knowledge you have to impart. This can be a great way for a Data Scientist to give back to the industry as well as set a more realistic benchmark of your perceived value.

### REMEMBER WHAT YOU DO WELL.

Psychologists Suzanne Imes, PhD, and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD, in the 1970s, impostor phenomenon occurs among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success.

Imes encourages her clients to make a realistic assessment of their abilities. “Most high achievers are pretty smart people, and many really smart people wish they were geniuses. But most of us aren’t,” she says. “We have areas where we’re quite smart and areas where we’re not so smart.” She suggests writing down the things you’re truly good at, and the areas that might need work. That can help you recognize where you’re doing well, and where there’s legitimate room for improvement.

## REALIZE NO ONE IS PERFECT.

Clance urges people with impostor feelings to stop focusing on perfection. “Do a task ‘well enough,'” she says. It’s also important to take time to appreciate the fruits of your hard work. “Develop and implement rewards for success — learn to celebrate,” she adds.

### CHANGE YOUR THINKING.

>“let the challenge excite you rather than overwhelm you.”

People with impostor feelings must reframe the way they think about their achievements, says Imes. She helps her clients gradually chip away at the superstitious thinking that fuels the impostor cycle. That has best done incrementally, she says. For instance, rather than spending 10 hours on an assignment, you might cut yourself off at eight. Or you may let a friend read a draft that you haven’t yet perfectly polished. “Superstitions need to be changed very gradually because they are so strong,” she says.

Avoid all or nothing thinking. Just like a standard distribution, most Data Scientists fall within the center. If you find yourself comparing to outliers, then you are going to continue to feel like a fraud, which will in return stifle your career in data science.

### TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP.

For many people with impostor feelings, individual therapy can be extremely helpful. A psychologist or other therapist can give you tools to help you break the cycle of impostor thinking.

The impostor phenomenon is still an experience that tends to fly under the radar. Often the people affected by impostor feelings don’t realize they could be living some other way.

This is something I did not expect, but I confirmed it with my recruiter friend the other day. She told me that within few days days, they received 400+ applications, mostly juniors without data experience. Since they couldn't go through all of them just to get to those with actual data experience, the company decided to instead reintroduce the same job but radically push up the YOE expected so that they can get to actual viable candidates. In others words, a slow death of 2+ YOE data positions that were once a staple in the industry.

This is crazy to me and I don't know what to think. Normally, with my \~3 YOE I would've qualified for the original data scientist position. But now that these roles have been converted to Senior with 5+ years, I've become suddenly incapable of applying to these positions (auto filters from ATS systems for example). I'm starting to play the blame game, which isn't really healthy behavior, but I don't know where to take out the rage.

I understand that YOE is just a number, but the bigger issue is that there seems to be enough super seniors in the market for companies to feel confident about redirecting their efforts to targeting these super seniors instead of more mid level people (forget college grads or those without any data experience atm), and not feel worried about the potential cost of their actions. This is the most shocking part, that people with 4, 5+ YOE haven't been absorbed into the job market yet in this economy, and these are the people I'm competing against.

**Edit:** all the Data Science jobs I've bookmarked few days ago are ""no longer accepting applications"". This is ridiculous, I bookmark them on the same day the positions came out.

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

>"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

>Support for CUDA in WSL will be included with NVIDIA’s WDDMv2.9 driver. Similar to D3D12 support, support for the CUDA API will be automatically installed and available on any glibc-based WSL distro if you have an NVIDIA GPU. The libcuda.so library gets deployed on the host alongside libd3d12.so, mounted and added to the loader search path using the same mechanism described previously.

k978cq,MachineLearning,1607444563.0,"First off, I just joined, so if this post is not appropriate for this sub, please say so.  I'm a high school math and CS teacher in Vermont, USA. I have a student who is working on an independent project that is waaaay beyond the CS knowledge/ability of anyone in my building.  He is investigating the question of whether an AI can create ""true art"". The student maintains a blog as a part of documenting his progress/learning and for a while I was able to give him feedback that was meaningful to some extent but at this point, as I said, he's beyond me.

So -- with his permission -- I am posting a link to his blog and to his Github account.  I would love it if a few people here would take a look at what he's doing and leave him a comment about his work. My biggest concern is that I can't help him identify moments when he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

Why should you do this? Well, this student is pretty off the charts in terms of CS. I would be surprised if he doesn't end up changing tech for the world at some point. If you read and comment on his blog, you'll be able to say, ""Oh yeah, I knew that guy before anyone had heard of him.""  😀 And even if he doesn't become famous some day, he's still a kid who is full of ideas and would benefit from some adult interest, support in his work. Think of it as your good deed for the day.

Again, if this post is not appropriate for this sub, please let me know and I'll remove it.

jmwrcr,datascience,1604352837.0,"**TL;DR:** switched from software engineering to data science 3 years ago looking for a more challenging career. Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and since then have spent another 3 years as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams, work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jmwrcr/seriously_how_am_i_expected_to_grow_in_a/,"Seriously, how am I expected to grow in a profession where everyone discourages me from building anything non-trivial",Career,448,143,0.95

gtv2c9,datascience,1590912218.0,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

eg8mmn,MachineLearning,1577435368.0,"- Long short-term memory. S Hochreiter, J Schmidhuber. Neural computation, MIT Press, 1997 (26k citations as of 2019)

It has passed the backpropagation papers by Rumelhart et al. (1985, 1986, 1987). Don't get confused by Google Scholar which sometimes incorrectly lumps together different Rumelhart publications including: 

- Learning internal representations by error propagation. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, California Univ San Diego La Jolla, Inst for Cognitive Science, 1985 (25k)

- Parallel distributed processing. JL McClelland, DE Rumelhart, PDP Research Group, MIT press, 1987 (24k)

- Learning representations by back-propagating errors. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, Nature 323 (6088), 533-536, 1986 (19k) 

I think it's good that the backpropagation paper is no longer number one, because it's a bad role model. It does not cite the true inventors of backpropagation, and the authors have never corrected this. I learned this on reddit: [Schmidhuber on Linnainmaa, inventor of backpropagation in 1970](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e5vzun/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_on_seppo_linnainmaa_inventor/). This post also mentions Kelley (1960) and Werbos (1982). 

The LSTM paper is now receiving more citations per year than all of Rumelhart's backpropagation papers combined. And  more than the most cited paper by LeCun and Bengio (1998) which is about CNNs: 

- Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Y LeCun, L Bottou, Y Bengio, P Haffner, IEEE 86 (11), 2278-2324, 1998 (23k)
 
It may soon have more citations than Bishop's textbook on neural networks (1995).  

In the 21st century, activity in the field has surged, and I found three deep learning research papers with even more citations. All of them are about applications of neural networks to ImageNet (2012, 2014, 2015). One paper describes a fast, CUDA-based, deep CNN (AlexNet) that won ImageNet 2012. Another paper describes a significantly deeper CUDA CNN that won ImageNet 2014:  

- A Krizhevsky, I Sutskever, GE Hinton. Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. NeuerIPS 2012 (53k) 

- B. K Simonyan, A Zisserman. Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. arXiv:1409.1556, 2014 (32k)

The paper with the most citations per year is a recent one on the much deeper ResNet which won ImageNet 2015: 

- K He, X Zhang, S Ren, J Sun. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. CVPR 2016 (36k; 18k in 2019)

Remarkably, such ""contest-winning deep GPU-based CNNs"" can also be traced back to the Schmidhuber lab. Krizhevsky cites DanNet, the first CUDA CNN to win image recognition challenges and the first superhuman CNN (2011). I learned this on reddit: [DanNet, the CUDA CNN of Dan Ciresan in Jürgen Schmidhuber's team, won 4 image recognition challenges prior to AlexNet](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dwnuwh/d_dannet_the_cuda_cnn_of_dan_ciresan_in_jurgen/): ICDAR 2011 Chinese handwriting contest - IJCNN 2011 traffic sign recognition contest - ISBI 2012 image segmentation contest - ICPR 2012 medical imaging contest.  

ResNet is much deeper than DanNet and AlexNet and works even better. It cites the [Highway Net](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html) (Srivastava & Greff & Schmidhuber, 2015) of which it is a special case. In a sense, this closes the LSTM circle, because ""Highway Nets are essentially feedforward versions of recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.""

Most LSTM citations refer to the 1997 LSTM paper. However, Schmidhuber's [post on their Annus Mirabilis](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) points out that ""essential insights"" for LSTM date back to Seep Hochreiter's 1991 diploma thesis which he considers ""one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning."" (He also credits other students: ""LSTM and its training procedures were further improved"" ""through the work of my later students Felix Gers, Alex Graves, and others."")

The LSTM principle is essential for both recurrent networks and feedforward networks. Today it is on every smartphone. And in Deepmind's Starcraft champion and OpenAI's Dota champion. And in thousands of additional applications.

To the reviewer that said our paper was ""underdeveloped"" because we didn't use a different methodology Y from field Z, we'd like to point out that a) this is in field A, b) we provided a framework for how to extend this to other methodologies in field A, and c) methodology Y has no obvious way to extend to the problem we're addressing (and doing so would be a whole paper in its own right).  Do you often read papers and get frustrated that they aren't the papers you've written?

To the same reviewer, who asked why we didn't cite papers Z1 and Z2, we would again point out that this isn't field Z and those papers have no relevance to the topic at hand except that you'd have written a paper on a different topic, which we didn't.

To the reviewer that asked why we didn't cite X, we'd like to point out that we did cite X, and had a whole paragraph discussing the relationship of this work to that one.

To the reviewer that proposed an example dataset to evaluate our model on, we point out that we already evaluate the model on that data set; see our Experiments section.

To the reviewer that pointed out that our method won't work when assumption 3 isn't met, yes, you're correct.  That's why we stated it as an assumption.  Congratulations on your reading comprehension.

To the reviewer that directly copy/pasted our introduction into the ""what 3 things does this paper contribute"" box, we'll be sure to include in future revisions a copy/paste-able review justifying ""score 10, confidence 5"" to make your review easier.  That you also confused our main claim with a work we were citing, and otherwise completely missed the discussion on relationship to prior work or what makes this paper novel, makes your review particularly useful to development of the work.

To the reviewer that wrote that, while THEY were familiar with the definitions in a reference, we should explain it for readers that might be confused, we understand entirely.  We'll gladly explain it for ""a friend of yours"", err ""readers"", and not you, because you get it and you're smart and it's just the readers who don't.

To the reviewer who commented that our results were ""contradictory"" because we said that our modification ""in general performed slightly worse"" on this metric, when in fact our plots show it sometimes performed better, we'll gladly fix our claim to be clear that ""in general"" doesn't mean ""always"" and also our results are even better than the previous wording indicated.

To the reviewer that said our comparison method's results were worse than reported in the original paper, we've carefully compared their bar charts to ours and found that the results are the same to the precision of the graphical printout in the previous paper.  If you could lend us your image sharpening function so we can get more significant digits out of their plot, we'd be glad to redo the comparison.

To the reviewer who used half of their review to argue that our entire subfield is dumb and wrong, we thank them for reaching across academic lines to provide commentary in an area that pains you deeply.

And finally, to the reviewers who called our paper (all actual quotes) ""original, well-motivated, and worthy of study"", ""important in its own right"", that said you ""greatly enjoyed reading this paper"" and that ""this is an interesting problem and certainly worth studying"" and that ""this paper identifies an important problem ... [and the authors] then present a simple"" solution, thank you for also marking this a reject.  Since all of you gave us scores between 5 and 3, neither the AC nor any of you will ever have to read this response or reconsider your scores before we are inevitably rejected, but we hope that your original, well-motivated, worth-studying, important, interesting, clear papers receive reviews of equal quality in the future!

I spent 3 months to finally get a few models on github to work properly, but only after spending countless hours hunting out the problems in the preprocessing and evaluation code.


Now, I was asked to add another layer on top of the baselines. The PhD student directed me to another github repo from a paper that implements similar things. I just plugged my existing code into the it and somehow the model went to shit again! I went through every steps but just can't figure out what's wrong.

I can't do it anymore... Every week's meeting with the PhD student is just filled with dread knowing I have no progress to report again.

Edit: 

Thank you for all the support and suggestions! Was not expecting this at all. Few problems I identified are:
* Lack of communication with the PhD student and other research members, so I have no idea how to work on a project like this properly.
* Lack of theoretical understanding and familiarity with the model and pipeline set up so I had a hard time diagnosing the problem.
* This is a bit whiney but ML codes published by researchers are so freaking hard to read and understand! Sometimes they left broken code in their repo; and everyone codes their preprocessing stage differently so some subtle changes can easily lead to different outcomes.

Anyway, I just contacted the PhD student and came clean to him about the difficulties. Let's see what he thinks...

[The Machine Learning Lifecycle](https://youtu.be/ZmBUnJ7lGvQ)

and

[Types of Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised](https://youtu.be/wy-m6sd1BOA)

Check out our ML Tidbits [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD7qIRMUvUJQzbTXaMaNO2Q) for short and sweet explanations, discussions, and debates about ML topics. We're planning to release new videos on a weekly basis Our goal is to make ML accessible to the public, so that everyone can participate in discussions and make educated decisions about ML products and policies. We believe that teaching responsible ML from the start will create more accountability and enable better public discussions around the societal impacts of this technology.

My main advice is to be as critical to the company as they are to you:

Screen their job posting with as much rigour as they screen your CV trying to get a sense of what you'll *really* be doing irrespective of your 'data scientist' job title. Typical red flags for me would be (not exhaustive):

* No mention of cloud related tooling.
* SQL and data warehousing featuring more promintently than anything else. Reason being that if I wanted to do a DA job, which I really enjoyed from past experiences, I would just apply for that.
* No mention of any kind of version control.
* ""Use whatever tools and languages you want on the job"". This one is very particular but to me that would indicate no standardisation, probably a lot of csv files, excel users, ad-hoc analysis on notebooks and very little being put into production / automated. This might be a pet peeve but I believe in many cases long term value from data can't *just* be done through ad-hoc analyses and 99 % of companies aren't mature enough to let everyone use their own tools without it becoming an unmaintanable mess.
* No mention of anything casual. This one is personal, colleagues are colleagues and not necessarily friends but a workplace with a few social amenities would make being 8-9 hours in the office more bearable.

Not all of the information you value can be gotten from the job posting so the next step would be to think about what you value ahead of the interview and ask them in a polite manner. Job interviews should be as much of you deciding if they are a fit for you as vice versa.

This may help you to uncover small details that can help you decide picking one offer over the other. Even if you only have 1 offer knowing what you're getting into in advance can help you make peace with / prepare for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/puh45x/advice_to_all_job_seekers_be_as_critical_to_the/,Advice to all job seekers: be as critical to the company as they are to you,Discussion,432,56,0.97

At my current job as an ML engineer at a tiny startup (4 people when I joined, now 9), we're currently hiring for a data science role and I thought it might be worth sharing what I'm seeing as we go through the resumes.

We left the job posting up for 1 day, for a Data Science position. We're located in Waterloo, Ontario. For this nobody company, in 24 hours we received 88 applications.

Within these application there are more people with Master's degrees than either a flat Bachelor's or PhD. I'm only half way through reviewing, but those that are moving to the next round are in the realm of matching niche experience we might find useful, or are highly qualified (PhD's with X-years of experience).

This has been eye opening to just how flooded the market is right now, and I feel it is just shocking to see what the response rate for this role is. Our full-stack postings in the past have not received nearly the same attention.

If you're job hunting, don't get discouraged, but be aware that as it stands there seems to be an oversupply of **interest**, not necessarily qualified individuals.

ep8m3q,MachineLearning,1579123068.0,"Facebook AI has built the first AI system that can solve advanced mathematics equations using symbolic reasoning. By developing a new way to represent complex mathematical expressions as a kind of language and then treating solutions as a translation problem for sequence-to-sequence neural networks, we built a system that outperforms traditional computation systems at solving integration problems and both first- and second-order differential equations.

Previously, these kinds of problems were considered out of the reach of deep learning models, because solving complex equations requires precision rather than approximation. Neural networks excel at learning to succeed through approximation, such as recognizing that a particular pattern of pixels is likely to be an image of a dog or that features of a sentence in one language match those in another. Solving complex equations also requires the ability to work with symbolic data, such as the letters in the formula b - 4ac = 7. Such variables can’t be directly added, multiplied, or divided, and using only traditional pattern matching or statistical analysis, neural networks were limited to extremely simple mathematical problems.

Our solution was an entirely new approach that treats complex equations like sentences in a language. This allowed us to leverage proven techniques in neural machine translation (NMT), training models to essentially translate problems into solutions. Implementing this approach required developing a method for breaking existing mathematical expressions into a language-like syntax, as well as generating a large-scale training data set of more than 100M paired equations and solutions.

When presented with thousands of unseen expressions — equations that weren’t part of its training data — our model performed with significantly more speed and accuracy than traditional, algebra-based equation-solving software, such as Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. This work not only demonstrates that deep learning can be used for symbolic reasoning but also suggests that neural networks have the potential to tackle a wider variety of tasks, including those not typically associated with pattern recognition. We’re sharing details about our approach as well as methods to help others generate similar training sets.

A new way to apply NMT

Humans who are particularly good at symbolic math often rely on a kind of intuition. They have a sense of what the solution to a given problem should look like — such as observing that if there is a cosine in the function we want to integrate, then there may be a sine in its integral — and then do the necessary work to prove it. This is different from the direct calculation required for algebra. By training a model to detect patterns in symbolic equations, we believed that a neural network could piece together the clues that led to their solutions, roughly similar to a human’s intuition-based approach to complex problems. So we began exploring symbolic reasoning as an NMT problem, in which a model could predict possible solutions based on examples of problems and their matching solutions.

An example of how our approach expands an existing equation (on the left) into an expression tree that can serve as input for a translation model. For this equation, the preorder sequence input into our model would be: (plus, times, 3, power, x, 2, minus, cosine, times, 2, x, 1).

To implement this application with neural networks, we needed a novel way of representing mathematical expressions. NMT systems are typically sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, using sequences of words as input, and outputting new sequences, allowing them to translate complete sentences rather than individual words. We used a two-step approach to apply this method to symbolic equations. First, we developed a process that effectively unpacks equations, laying them out in a branching, treelike structure that can then be expanded into sequences that are compatible with seq2seq models. Constants and variables act as leaves, while operators (such as plus and minus) and functions are the internal nodes that connect the branches of the tree.

&#x200B;

Though it might not look like a traditional language, organizing expressions in this way provides a language-like syntax for equations — numbers and variables are nouns, while operators act as verbs. Our approach enables an NMT model to learn to align the patterns of a given tree-structured problem with its matching solution (also expressed as a tree), similar to matching a sentence in one language with its confirmed translation. This method lets us leverage powerful, out-of-the-box seq2seq NMT models, swapping out sequences of words for sequences of symbols.

&#x200B;

Building a new data set for training

Though our expression-tree syntax made it theoretically possible for an NMT model to effectively translate complex math problems into solutions, training such a model would require a large set of examples. And because in the two classes of problems we focused on — integration and differential equations — a randomly generated problem does not always have a solution, we couldn’t simply collect equations and feed them into the system. We needed to generate an entirely novel training set consisting of examples of solved equations restructured as model-readable expression trees. This resulted in problem-solution pairs, similar to a corpus of sentences translated between languages. Our set would also have to be significantly larger than the training data used in previous research in this area, which has attempted to train systems on thousands of examples. Since neural networks generally perform better when they have more training data, we created a set with millions of examples.

&#x200B;

Building this data set required us to incorporate a range of data cleaning and generation techniques. For our symbolic integration equations, for example, we flipped the translation approach around: Instead of generating problems and finding their solutions, we generated solutions and found their problem (their derivative), which is a much easier task. This approach of generating problems from their solutions — what engineers sometimes refer to as trapdoor problems — made it feasible to create millions of integration examples. Our resulting translation-inspired data set consists of roughly 100M paired examples, with subsets of integration problems as well as first- and second-order differential equations.

&#x200B;

We used this data set to train a seq2seq transformer model with eight attention heads and six layers. Transformers are commonly used for translation tasks, and our network was built to predict the solutions for different kinds of equations, such as determining a primitive for a given function. To gauge our model’s performance, we presented it with 5,000 unseen expressions, forcing the system to recognize patterns within equations that didn’t appear in its training. Our model demonstrated 99.7 percent accuracy when solving integration problems, and 94 percent and 81.2 percent accuracy, respectively, for first- and second-order differential equations. Those results exceeded those of all three of the traditional equation solvers we tested against. Mathematica achieved the next best results, with 84 percent accuracy on the same integration problems and 77.2 percent and 61.6 percent for differential equation results. Our model also returned most predictions in less than 0.5 second, while the other systems took several minutes to find a solution and sometimes timed out entirely.

Our model took the equations on the left as input — equations that both Mathematica and Matlab were unable to solve — and was able to find correct solutions (shown on the right) in less than one second.

Comparing generated solutions to reference solutions allowed us to easily and precisely validate the results. But our model is also able to produce multiple solutions for a given equation. This is similar to what happens in machine translation, where there are many ways to translate an input sentence.

What’s next for equation-solving AI

Our model currently works on problems with a single variable, and we plan to expand it to multiple-variable equations. This approach could also be applied to other mathematics- and logic-based fields, such as physics, potentially leading to software that assists scientists in a broad range of work.

But our system has broader implications for the study and use of neural networks. By discovering a way to use deep learning where it was previously seen as unfeasible, this work suggests that other tasks could benefit from AI. Whether through the further application of NLP techniques to domains that haven’t traditionally been associated with languages, or through even more open-ended explorations of pattern recognition in new or seemingly unrelated tasks, the perceived limitations of neural networks may be limitations of imagination, not technology.

Overall, our  contribution substantially advances the current methodology for  detecting CHF and caters to clinical practitioners’ needs by providing  an accurate and fully transparent tool to support decisions concerning  CHF detection.

1) The typical data scientist: This is what we typically how we imagine a data scientist.  The role involves a bit of data exploration, ML model building, presentations to management, etc.




2) The deep learning data scientist: This is kind of like the previous example, but with a greater emphasis on deep learning over traditional ML.  The role is more likely to ask for a PhD.  This role looks at more interesting problems in my opinion, such as computer vision and NLP.





3) The data engineering data scientist: This is like my current role.  I work on ETL pipelines and bring new data to data scientists in the previous categories for ML model building.  Because of my job title, I might be asked to do some data analysis work.  I work a lot with python, SQL, and AWS.





4) Software Engineer (Data Science): This data scientist is in reality a software engineer attached to a data science team.  This is not as common, but definitely exists.



5) The data analyst with a data scientist job title: With this type of data scientist, there is less python and ML, and more SQL, Excel, and presentations.  Hiring managers typically look at non-technical skills over technical skills.

I posted about not being able to reproduce a paper today and apparently it struck a chord with a lot of people who have faced the issue.

I'm not sure if this is the best or worst idea ever but I figured it would be useful to collect a list of papers which people have tried to reproduce and failed. This will give the authors a chance to either release their code, provide pointers or rescind the paper. My hope is that this incentivizes a healthier ML research culture around not publishing unreproducible work.

I realize that this system can be abused so in order to ensure that the reputation of the authors is not unnecessarily tarnished, the authors will be given a week to respond and their response will be reflected in the spreadsheet. It would be great if this can morph into a post-acceptance OpenReview kind of thing where the authors can have a dialogue with people trying to build off their work.

This is ultimately an experiment so I'm open to constructive feedback that best serves our community.

I am doing a PhD in machine learning but my field is heavily based in computer vision and also some techniques from natural language processing, so I'm mostly doing deep learning.

I have some conference contributions, but none of them in major conferences. Reviewers are always fairly critical but I have not gotten a rejection yet (though last time was pretty close).

I get why they are critical too. I'm not a top student, our lab is not a top lab, and what I do is mostly repurpose existing methods for different domains. Think taking a ResNet and applying it to medical imaging, or transformers for music classification (not actually my domains).

I feel like compared to many others, I heavily lack in mathematical background even though I try to read up, I often immediately forget concepts that I don't actually apply. I couldn't tell you what the rank of a matrix is, let alone how to use it.

This is partly why I don't really come up with new methods. I'm better at combining existing stuff, but it doesn't feel like research but more like engineering at times.

Because my contributions are fairly underwhelming, I don't think I will be able to achieve a career in academia. So I will likely look for a job in the industry.

dq82x7,MachineLearning,1572632241.0,"I recently read the paper ""Adversarial Training for Review-Based Recommendations"" published on the SIGIR 2019 conference. I noticed that this paper is almost exactly the same as the paper ""Why I like it: Multi-task Learning for Recommendation and Explanation"" published on the RecSys 2018 conference.

At first, I thought it is just a coincidence. It is likely for researchers to have similar ideas. Therefore it is possible that two research groups independently working on the same problem come up with the same solution. However, after thoroughly reading and comparing the two papers, now I believe that the SIGIR 2019 paper is plagiarizing the RecSys 2018 paper.

The model proposed in the SIGIR 2019 paper is almost a replicate of the model in the RecSys 2018 paper. (1) Both papers used an adversarial sequence-to-sequence learning model on top of the matrix factorization framework. (2) For the generator and discriminator part, both papers use GRU for generator and CNN for discriminator. (3) The optimization methodology is the same, i.e. alternating optimization between two parts. (4) The evaluations are the same, i.e. evaluating MSE for recommendation performance and evaluating the accuracy for discriminator to show that the generator has learned to generate relevant reviews. (5) The notations and also the formulas that have been used by the two papers look extremely similar.

While ideas can be similar given that adversarial training has been prevalent in the literature for a while, it is suspicious for the SIGIR 2019 paper to have large amount of text overlaps with the RecSys 2018 paper.

Consider the following two sentences:

(1) ""The Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

I think this is the most obvious sign of plagiarism. If you search Google for this sentence using ""exact match"", you will find that this sentence is only used by these two papers. It is hard to believe that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper could come up with the exact same sentence without reading the RecSys 2018 paper.

As another example:

(1) ""The decoder employs a single GRU that iteratively produces reviews word by word. In particular, at time step $t$ the GRU first maps the output representation $z\_{ut-1}$ of the previous time step into a $k$-dimensional vector $y\_{ut-1}$ and concatenates it with $\\bar{U\_{u}}$ to generate a new vector $y\_{ut}$. Finally, $y\_{ut}$ is fed to the GRU to obtain the hidden representation $h\_{t}$, and then $h\_{t}$ is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary of the document to represent the probability of each word. The output word $z\_{ut}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 2.1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""The user review decoder utilizes a single decoder GRU that iteratively generates reviews word by word. At time step $t$, the decoder GRU first embeds the output word $y\_{i, t-1}$ at the previous time step into the corresponding word vector $x\_{i, t-1} \\in \\mathcal{R}\^{k}$, and then concatenate it with the user textual feature vector $\\widetilde{U\_{i}}$. The concatenated vector is provided as input into the decoder GRU to obtain the hidden activation $h\_{t}$. Then the hidden activation is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary to represent the probability of each word given the current context. The output word $y\_{i, t}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 3.1.1 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

In this example, the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper has replaced some of the phrases in the writing so that the two texts are not exactly the same. However, I believe the similarity of the two texts still shows that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper must have read the RecSys 2018 paper before writing their own paper.

I do not intend to go through all the text overlaps between the two papers, but let us see a final example:

(1) ""Each word of the review $r$ is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector. Notice that the user-specific vectors are learned together with the parameters of the discriminator $D\_{\\theta}$ in the adversarial training of Section 2.3. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected projection layer. The final output of the CNN is a sigmoid function which normalizes the probability into the interval of $\[0, 1\]$"", expressing the probability that the candidate review $r$ is written by user $u$."" in Section 2.2 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""To begin with, each word in the review is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector that identifies user information. The user-specific vectors are learned together with other parameters during training. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. The final output unit is a sigmoid non-linearity, which squashes the probability into the $\[0, 1\]$ interval."" in Section 3.1.2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

There is one sentence (""The concatenated vector representations are ...... a fully-connected projection layer."") that is exactly the same in the two papers. Also, I think concatenating the user-specific vectors to every word vector in the review is a very unintuitive idea. I do not think ideas from different research groups can be the same in that granularity of detail. If I were the authors, I will just concatenate the user-specific vectors to the layer before the final projection layer, as it saves computational cost and should lead to better generalization.

As a newbie in information retrieval, I am not sure if such case should be considered as plagiarism. However, as my professor told me that the SIGIR conference is the premier conference in the IR community, I believe that this paper definitely should not be published at a top conference such as SIGIR.

What makes me feel worse is that the two authors of this paper, Dimitrios Rafailidis from Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands and Fabio Crestani from Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland, are both professors. They should be aware that plagiarism is a big deal in academia.

has got me thinking. A source code requirement would make this by far the most reproducible community in the history of experimental science. Our experiments are programs that run *DETERMINISTICALLY*. If you speak with other scientific communities about our reproducibility issues, they are baffled.

I have just skimmed part of the book but it looks very good and contains lots of insight from a recruiter point of view that I would never know otherwise and is applicable to more than just ML interview IMO. What do you think?

Quote from the Github page:

This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who  have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time  thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in  mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they  found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink  their own process.

The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview  of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine  learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds  of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part  also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they  look for.

The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted  with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should  expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common  misconceptions in machine learning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/o6ce13/d_machine_learning_interview_book_by_huyen_chip/,[D] Machine Learning Interview book by Huyen Chip.,Discussion,423,29,0.96

1. Over the next couple years, someone will come up with an optimizer/optimization approach that completely changes how people optimize neural networks. In particular, there's quite some evidence that the neural network training doesn't quite work how we think it is. For one, there's several papers showing that very early stages of training are far more important than the rest of training. There's also other papers isolating interesting properties of training like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.

2. GANs are going to get supplanted by another generative model paradigm - probably VAEs, flow-based methods, or energy-based models. I think there's just too many issues with GANs - in particular lack of diversity. Despite the 50 papers a year claiming to solve mode collapse, oftentimes GANs still seem to have issues with representatively sampling the data distribution (e.g: PULSE).

Abstract:

>Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g., for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multi-modal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, **exhibits positive transfer**: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. **Our largest model, PaLM-E-562B with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.**

So, last year I completed my masters and joined one of the big 4 firms as a data scientist. As excited as I was in the beginning, 6 months down the line I’ve started to hate my job.

I always thought working a data science job would make my knowledge base grow, but it seems like in consulting no one gives a damn about your knowledge because no one cares if you’re right, they just want to please the client. Isn’t the point of analysing and modelling data to learn from it, to draw insights? At consulting firms everything is so client oriented that all you end up doing is serving to the client’s bias. It doesn’t matter if you modelled the data right, if the client “thinks” the estimate should be x, it should come out to be x. Then why the hell do you want me to build you a model? 

The job is all about making good looking ppts and achieving estimates the client wants you to and closing the project. There isn’t any belief in the process of data science, no respect for the maths behind it

Edit; People who are commenting, I would love some help regarding my career. What should I do next? What industries are popular for having in-house data scientists who do meaningful jobs? Also, for some context, I’ve a masters in economics.

lrkob9,datascience,1614193573.0,"Hello all    

I've seen some posts about interview questions here recently and thought I would share some of the questions I ask applicants for our data science positions. Maybe we can have a small discussion on other peoples questions. If you ask why I write this, my small daughter is currently in the hospital and the don't let me in due to Covid rules so I need something to keep me busy (edit: she's fine now).

I currently work in a retail company as a data scientist. We only hire people fresh from university (decision of my bosses) to grow them into the business, usually with master degrees. I studied statistics, therefore it falls to me to assess the statistical knowledge of the applicants.

So what do I look for? We are not a tech or AI company, we need people with a solid understanding of classical statistics, not just ML, as that will be necessary a lot of times. What I want to know is whether the applicant has a good grasp and intuition about statistics. We are a team of people, it is likely someone will know which algorithms and methods might be applicable to your problem, so you don't need to know all the algorithms (you would read up on them anyway), but you need the intuition or training to know that there is a problem (see e.g. my example on multiple testing below). In addition, I personally think that our value doesn't lie in calling fit(X, y), but being able to figure out if the model coming from it is appropriate and useful.

This brings me to the questions I ask. I usually have three questions prepared, which can slightly vary between applicants based on their education. Also I always give applicants my laprop and tell them they can lookup things if they want to.

In the first question, I show a piece of code which generates some data (with p > n) and generates a (collinear) feature. Then a linear model is fitted and the summary printed which is full of NAs. Then I ask them to help me debug why my model gives NAs. This usually leads to a discussion about data quality, features and data preparation.

Then for the second questions, I show the diagnostic plots for a linear regression model I fabricated filled with the usual caveats, heteroskedacity and a missing feature which leads to biased results (e.g. predicts negative values for a strictly positive quantity). Here we have a discussion about model validation and implications of a lack thereof, starting at the given example and then some questions about e.g. cross validation.

And at last my personal favorite, I show people this comic here https://xkcd.com/882/ and ask them to explain it to me. This normally leads to a discussion about p values, hypothesis testing and multiple testing correction, maybe also expectation values. I don't need you to know which algorithm to use (or just p.adjust()), but that you recognize that doing 20 tests without accounting for it is problematic.

This is then followed by a short case study with a problem I solved one or two years ago where I am present and the can discuss with me about what data is available and whether what they propose is feasable. What interests me here the most is not really the idea you come up with but how you get there. What I noticed here is that the people who do well at first try to visualize the problem with some sketches and example cases which really helps them to order their thoughts and me to help them if they get completely stuck.

I hope this read has been helpful or interesting to you, I'd be happy to read about questions you ask in interviews.

srbvnc,MachineLearning,1644732828.0,"Hello r/MachineLearning!

In this post, I will be explaining why I decided to create a machine learning library in C++ from scratch.

If you are interested in taking a closer look at it, the GitHub repository is available here: [https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP](https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP). To give some background, the library is over 13.0K lines of code and incorporates topics from statistics, linear algebra, numerical analysis, and of course, machine learning and deep learning. I have started working on the library since I was 15.

Quite honestly, the main reason why I started this work is simply because C++ is my language of choice. The language is efficient and is good for fast execution. When I began looking over the implementations of various machine learning algorithms, I noticed that most, if not all of the implementations, were in Python, MatLab, R, or Octave. My understanding is that the main reason for C++’s lack of usage in the ML sphere is due to the lack of user support and the complex syntax of C++. There are thousands of libraries and packages in Python for mathematics, linear algebra, machine learning and deep learning, while C++ does not have this kind of user support. You could count the most robust libraries for machine learning in C++ on your fingers.

There is one more reason why I started developing this library. I’ve noticed that because ML algorithms can be implemented so easily, some engineers often glance over or ignore the implementational and mathematical details behind them. This can lead to problems along the way because specializing ML algorithms for a particular use case is impossible without knowing its mathematical details. As a result, along with the library, I plan on releasing comprehensive documentation which will explain all of the mathematical background behind each machine learning algorithm in the library and am hoping other engineers will find this helpful. It will cover everything from statistics, to linear regression, to the Jacobian and backpropagation. The following is an excerpt from the statistics section:

[https://ibb.co/w4MDGvw](https://ibb.co/w4MDGvw)

Well, everyone, that’s all the background I have for this library. If you have any comments or feedback, don't hesitate to share!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** 

Hello, everyone! Thank you so much for upvoting and taking the time to read my post- I really appreciate it. 

I would like to make a clarification regarding the rationale for creating the library- when I mean C++ does not get much support in the ML sphere, I am referring to the language in the context of a frontend for ML and not a backend. Indeed, most libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Numpy, all use either C/C++ or some sort of C/C++ derivative for optimization and speed. 

When it comes to C++ as an ML frontend- it is a different story. The amount of frameworks in machine learning for C++ pale in comparison to the amount for Python. Moreover, even in popular frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, the implementations for C++ are not as complete as those for Python: the documentation is lacking, not all of the main functions are present, not many are willing to contribute, etc.

In addition, C++ does not have support for various key libraries of Python's ML suite. Pandas lacks support for C++ and so does Matplotlib. This increases the implementation time of ML algorithms because the elements of data visualization and data analysis are more difficult to obtain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/srbvnc/p_c_machine_learning_library_built_from_scratch/,[P] C++ Machine Learning Library Built From Scratch by a 16-Year-Old High Schooler,Project,420,87,0.85

> For a while, some DeepMind employees referred to it as ""Watermelon."" Later, executives called it ""Mario."" Both code names meant the same thing: a secret plan to break away from parent company Google.
> 
> DeepMind feared Google might one day misuse its technology, and executives worked to distance the artificial-intelligence firm from its owner for years, said nine current and former employees who were directly familiar with the plans. 
> 
> This included plans to pursue an independent legal status that would distance the group's work from Google, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.
> 
> One core tension at DeepMind was that it sold the business to people it didn't trust, said one former employee. ""Everything that happened since that point has been about them questioning that decision,"" the person added.
> 
> Efforts to separate DeepMind from Google ended in April without a deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. The yearslong negotiations, along with recent shake-ups within Google's AI division, raise questions over whether the search giant can maintain control over a technology so crucial to its future.
> 
> ""DeepMind's close partnership with Google and Alphabet since the acquisition has been extraordinarily successful — with their support, we've delivered research breakthroughs that transformed the AI field and are now unlocking some of the biggest questions in science,"" a DeepMind spokesperson said in a statement. ""Over the years, of course we've discussed and explored different structures within the Alphabet group to find the optimal way to support our long-term research mission. We could not be prouder to be delivering on this incredible mission, while continuing to have both operational autonomy and Alphabet's full support.""
> 
> When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, the deal was seen as a win-win. Google got a leading AI research organization, and DeepMind, in London, won financial backing for its quest to build AI that can learn different tasks the way humans do, known as artificial general intelligence.
> 
> But tensions soon emerged. Some employees described a cultural conflict between researchers who saw themselves firstly as academics and the sometimes bloated bureaucracy of Google's colossal business. Others said staff were immediately apprehensive about putting DeepMind's work under the control of a tech giant. For a while, some employees were encouraged to communicate using encrypted messaging apps over the fear of Google spying on their work.
> 
> At one point, DeepMind's executives discovered that work published by Google's internal AI research group resembled some of DeepMind's codebase without citation, one person familiar with the situation said. ""That pissed off Demis,"" the person added, referring to Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's CEO. ""That was one reason DeepMind started to get more protective of their code.""
> 
> After Google restructured as Alphabet in 2015 to give riskier projects more freedom, DeepMind's leadership started to pursue a new status as a separate division under Alphabet, with its own profit and loss statement, The Information reported.
> 
> DeepMind already enjoyed a high level of operational independence inside Alphabet, but the group wanted legal autonomy too. And it worried about the misuse of its technology, particularly if DeepMind were to ever achieve AGI.
> 
> Internally, people started referring to the plan to gain more autonomy as ""Watermelon,"" two former employees said. The project was later formally named ""Mario"" among DeepMind's leadership, these people said.
> 
> ""Their perspective is that their technology would be too powerful to be held by a private company, so it needs to be housed in some other legal entity detached from shareholder interest,"" one former employee who was close to the Alphabet negotiations said. ""They framed it as 'this is better for society.'""
> 
> In 2017, at a company retreat at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort in Scotland, DeepMind's leadership disclosed to employees its plan to separate from Google, two people who were present said.
> 
> At the time, leadership said internally that the company planned to become a ""global interest company,"" three people familiar with the matter said. The title, not an official legal status, was meant to reflect the worldwide ramifications DeepMind believed its technology would have.
> 
> Later, in negotiations with Google, DeepMind pursued a status as a company limited by guarantee, a corporate structure without shareholders that is sometimes used by nonprofits. The agreement was that Alphabet would continue to bankroll the firm and would get an exclusive license to its technology, two people involved in the discussions said. There was a condition: Alphabet could not cross certain ethical redlines, such as using DeepMind technology for military weapons or surveillance. 
> 
> In 2019, DeepMind registered a new company called DeepMind Labs Limited, as well as a new holding company, filings with the UK's Companies House showed. This was done in anticipation of a separation from Google, two former employees involved in those registrations said.
> 
> Negotiations with Google went through peaks and valleys over the years but gained new momentum in 2020, one person said. A senior team inside DeepMind started to hold meetings with outside lawyers and Google to hash out details of what this theoretical new formation might mean for the two companies' relationship, including specifics such as whether they would share a codebase, internal performance metrics, and software expenses, two people said.
> 
> From the start, DeepMind was thinking about potential ethical dilemmas from its deal with Google. Before the 2014 acquisition closed, both companies signed an ""Ethics and Safety Review Agreement"" that would prevent Google from taking control of DeepMind's technology, The Economist reported in 2019. Part of the agreement included the creation of an ethics board that would supervise the research. 
> 
> Despite years of internal discussions about who should sit on this board, and vague promises to the press, this group ""never existed, never convened, and never solved any ethics issues,"" one former employee close to those discussions said. A DeepMind spokesperson declined to comment.
> 
> DeepMind did pursue a different idea: an independent review board to convene if it were to separate from Google, three people familiar with the plans said. The board would be made up of Google and DeepMind executives, as well as third parties. Former US president Barack Obama was someone DeepMind wanted to approach for this board, said one person who saw a shortlist of candidates.
> 
> DeepMind also created an ethical charter that included bans on using its technology for military weapons or surveillance, as well as a rule that its technology should be used for ways that benefit society. In 2017, DeepMind started a unit focused on AI ethics research composed of employees and external research fellows. Its stated goal was to ""pave the way for truly beneficial and responsible AI."" 
> 
> A few months later, a controversial contract between Google and the Pentagon was disclosed, causing an internal uproar in which employees accused Google of getting into ""the business of war."" 
> 
> Google's Pentagon contract, known as Project Maven, ""set alarm bells ringing"" inside DeepMind, a former employee said. Afterward, Google published a set of principles to govern its work in AI, guidelines that were similar to the ethical charter that DeepMind had already set out internally, rankling some of DeepMind's senior leadership, two former employees said.
> 
> In April, Hassabis told employees in an all-hands meeting that negotiations to separate from Google had ended. DeepMind would maintain its existing status inside Alphabet. DeepMind's future work would be overseen by Google's Advanced Technology Review Council, which includes two DeepMind executives, Google's AI chief Jeff Dean, and the legal SVP Kent Walker.
> 
> But the group's yearslong battle to achieve more independence raises questions about its future within Google.
> 
> Google's commitment to AI research has also come under question, after the company forced out two of its most senior AI ethics researchers. That led to an industry backlash and sowed doubt over whether it could allow truly independent research.
> 
> Ali Alkhatib, a fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics, told Insider that more public accountability was ""desperately needed"" to regulate the pursuit of AI by large tech companies. 
> 
> For Google, its investment in DeepMind may be starting to pay off. Late last year, DeepMind announced a breakthrough to help scientists better understand the behavior of microscopic proteins, which has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery.
> 
> As for DeepMind, Hassabis is holding on to the belief that AI technology should not be controlled by a single corporation. Speaking at Tortoise's Responsible AI Forum in June, he proposed a ""world institute"" of AI. Such a body might sit under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, Hassabis theorized, and could be filled with top researchers in the field.

We welcome abstract submissions from any domain of AI, however we highly encourage presentations in the following fields:  
​

* Computational models of narrative
* Automatic speech recognition
* Image generation 
* Natural language understanding
* Conversational AI
* Computer vision
* Computational creativity
* Music information retrieval
* Automatic musical understanding
* Video game AI

We are highlighting these topics due to their relationship to Animal Crossing and interacting with virtual characters. These fields have the potential to affect the depth of the interactions between people and virtual characters in any context, be they Animal Crossing villagers, virtual companions, or even virtual teachers. 

If you are interested in submitting, please head over to the [Submit an Abstract](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html) page.

[http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html)

​

**Presentation Logistics**

Each presentation will be 15 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes of questions from the audience. There are two components to each presentation: 1) Your Animal Crossing character will *give* the presentation in a workshop area on our workshop island. There will be workshop attendees on the island to *listen* to your talk. 2) You will call into a Zoom room, and give your talk over video call. You can also share your screen if you wish to use slides or whatever visual materials you desire. 

**Coffee Breaks + Chance Interactions** ☕☕☕☕

Since our desire is to replicate the social interactions of a real workshop, we will schedule coffee breaks into the workshop. We will have many different Zoom rooms so that smaller conversations can happen simultaneously. We want to provide a virtual space for you (the participant) to meet other researchers, and make meaningful connections. 

**Organizers**

This workshop is being organized by me, [Josh Eisenberg](http://www.research-josh.com/) PhD. I am an NLU researcher who focuses on teaching computers to understand narrative and dialogue. I am currently the lead scientist in NLU at [Artie Inc](http://artie.com/). I am putting this workshop together to build meaningful connections with other like-minded AI researchers, who also just happen to enjoy Animal Crossing.

If you have any questions or feedback please contact me at: [joshuadeisenberg@gmail.com](mailto:joshuadeisenberg@gmail.com)

**Dates**

Deadline for abstract submission: Friday June 12, 2020

""Under no circumstances should someone claim credit for someone else's work. I was involved in litigation against Google for something similar over 10 years ago.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day. Once again, my apologies for my failed try at providing you time-saving value and exposure. Site is down, time-saving, content aggregating, author visibility-enhancing site is no longer available.

gc29zj,datascience,1588403618.0,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

&#x200B;

Let me introduce our new work on *real-time photo-realistic* neural rendering. The method allows you to render complex scenes from *novel viewpoints* using *raw point clouds* as proxy geometry and require no meshes. Pipeline is following: scan object  with ordinary video camera, produce the point cloud using widely available software (e.g. Agisoft Metashape), feed the point cloud and video to the algorithm and that's it! At inference time *only* point cloud with learned descriptors is required.

&#x200B;

The core ingredient of our algorithm is 8-dimensional descriptors learned for each point in the cloud, instead of common 3-dimensional RGB colors. Rendering neural network interprets this descriptors and outputs RGB image. We train the network on large [Scannet](http://www.scan-net.org/) dataset to boost it's generalization capabilities on novel scenes.

For more details please refer to the paper, as well as short description of the method on the project page and video demonstrating the results.

I had some time between jobs so I wanted a hobby project where I can learn some Python. The result is a Twitter bot that is watching a bird feeder in my backyard for birds. If any birds are spotted, it tries to identify the species through a classification model. Both object detection and specie classification are done through existing models on TensorFlow hub. 

Nothing novel or new about this, but wanted to share this silly thing I put together.

kfaqxq,datascience,1608253570.0,"I’ve had the chance to meet tons of awesome tech professionals over the last 6 months.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far & I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your data science career.

**What is a Coffee Chat?**

A coffee chat is an informational interview where you find out more about a person’s professional experience and goals.

If there’s only one thing you get from this article, it should be the following: a coffee chat is not a place for you to ask for a job. It may certainly help you land a role in the future (and I’ll talk about this later), but if you’re going into a coffee chat with the sole intent of asking for a job, you’re doing it wrong.

Instead, a good coffee chat’s primary purpose should be to build trust and for both individuals to get to know each other.

**Why You Should Do Coffee Chats**

An obvious reason to go on more coffee chats is to increase your future chances of getting the role you want.

So assuming you want to work at Twitter on their Data Science team, you could go reach out to a data scientist there and speak with them for 30min. Assuming the conversation goes well, you can continue to follow up and stay in touch for a few months.

Then, say a year later, when you apply for a new data scientist role at Twitter, you can get referred, and sometimes you can even skip the whole line and directly meet with the hiring manager.

Another reason to go on a coffee chat is to find out about what a particular job role or industry consists of and to get information on how to break in. Here, you again reach out to someone who’s knowledgeable in a field and then ask them questions regarding what it is that they do.

So for example, let’s say I want to make a career transition into data science. I browse the data science subreddit and read a bunch of how-to posts and come across someone who’s written about their experience transitioning from biology to data science.

I decide that this person can give me useful tips so I send them an email and end up going on a coffee chat with them. This way, I can get direct advice from someone who’s done what I want to do.

If you’re reaching out to someone to ask for a job, you’re not asking for a coffee chat - you’re just asking for an interview. And that’s very different.

**How To Reach Out**

I recommend reaching out via email over Linkedin or Twitter. Everybody checks their email, even if they might not reply to you.

When sending an email to someone you want to go on a coffee chat with, keep it short and be specific. There’s probably a particular reason why you decided to reach out to someone - be sure to mention it in your email.

Here's an example:

***Email*** ***Example:***

In my senior year of college, I wanted to get a job in tech. As an international student, I had to get sponsorship and this was quite a big issue - I wanted to chat with someone who had been through this process before.

I came across Jay's Linkedin profile and realized that he was an international student who also had a similar economics related background to me ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_Linkedin_Profile_1.png)) and had also gotten a job in tech ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_v2.png)).

So when I reached out to him by email, I made sure to mention these things:

**-------**

*""Hey Jay,*

*International student from Cal, came across your profile - congrats on the job!*

*Wanted to chat about your experience recruiting in tech. Specifically, wanted to ask about:*

1. *How you bring up sponsorship with employers (at what stage, how you frame it etc)*
2. *Your econ background & how this has affected the type of roles you've looked at.*

*Let me know if a quick 20min chat this week would be possible.""*

**--------**

Notice how I didn’t say something generic like: “Would love to pick your brain”

Being specific when reaching out also makes sure that the recipient doesn’t think you’re randomly spamming people and sending the exact same copy to hundreds of people. You’re much more likely to get a response.

Finally, realize that the worst thing that happens is someone says no or doesn’t reply. No big deal, you’re still alive. Realize that most people will ignore your email. That’s okay.

And no, you’re not being “pushy” if you choose to follow-up. Just make sure you’ve taken the steps above to write a good message.

Okay, so let’s assume you’ve got someone to respond and they’re down to have a coffee chat with you. How do you prepare?

**How To Prepare**

Well, firstly, make sure *you do* prepare in advance. Someone’s given you their most valuable asset: their time. Don’t waste it.

When I’m about to speak with someone, I spend a minimum of 1 hour going through their profile and drafting up questions I want to ask them.

I’ll look at their Linkedin profile, see if they’ve published any blog posts, or if they’ve previously spoken on any panels. I’ll compile my notes in a google doc.

If the conversation is going well, you’ll find yourself asking a lot less questions and having a more two-way discussion, but I still recommend doing your research upfront.

When preparing questions, don’t just ask questions you could have looked up. Try to go a layer deeper - so instead of merely asking “Why did you transition into X?”, ask “Given your background in Y, what appealed you to X? Am I right in thinking that given my interests in A & B, I’ll also benefit from a transition into X?”

Ultimately, though, your questions don’t need to be perfect. A coffee chat is just a conversation with another person. And as long as you’re genuinely interested in finding out about their professional journey (rather than begging for a job), you’ll come across well.

**Guiding the Conversation and Asking Questions**

As I hinted at in the last section, whilst you should have a bank of questions to rely on, you don’t want the conversation to just be a series of questions and answers.

Instead, use your questions to add structure to your overall conversation, but let the discussion itself ebb and flow. Go on tangents - if something the other person says catches your interest, don’t be afraid to ask them about it.

There is no script and there shouldn’t be.

Keep in mind, though, that your first few coffee chats *will* likely involve just a bunch of questions and answers. But as you go on more and get more practice, just like anything else, you’ll develop a habit of steering the conversation in a manner that doesn’t involve just Q&A.

Finally, I also recommend taking notes - not necessarily to remember what you discussed, but rather as a tool to highlight the important parts of your conversation and to internalize some of your learnings better.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats, you’ve just made a new friend!

I recommend following up once right after your chat and sending a nice thank-you note.

Then, in the coming months, if you work on something cool or explore any new opportunities that are related to what you discussed, make sure to let them know!

As a slight tangent - you might be surprised at how many people end up reaching out to *you.*

After one of my coffee chats, I got a recruiter from one of the people I interviewed's company reaching out to me asking if I was interested in a new role they had.

Going on coffee chats is one of the best ways to increase future opportunities that come your way.

All they take is a bit of outreach and prep. And I hope this guide has proven to be a helpful start.

ee7xuq,datascience,1577037598.0,"There are several topics on this sub that are highly... partisan for lack of a better word.

What degree to pursue, PhD or not, Python vs. R, etc.

While different people will naturally have different opinions on the subject, I think it's particularly important to recognize that a person's path and past success will heavily bias their opinion.

Successful artists will tell up and coming ones to ""follow their dream"". But the reality is that a more personalized advice should probably be ""follow your dream if you're extremely talented, unique and have the family support to prevent you from ending up homeless"".

I think the same is true of this sub. Not everyone here has the inherent ability to become a Principal Scientist at Google, nor to become the Chief Data Officer for a Fortune 59 company. 
EDIT: I should have said ""not everyone has the right combination of inherent ability, work ethic, and/or life circumstances to become a (...). Inherent ability is one component, but the reality is that there are many reasons why a person may not get there - and not all of them are tied to ability.
Most importantly, not everyone's quality of life will be maximized by pursuing that life.

When you read advice on this sub, always keep a critical eye for how it applies to you, your inherent strengths and weaknesses, your current situation and your future opportunities.

Garth Brooks probably wouldn't take advice from Carrie Underwood. And if you are anything other that a generational talent of a guitar player, you should probably take any advice you get from Steve Vai with a gigantic grain of salt. 

If you're a world leading expert in computer vision, you don't need to take advice from people like me who have worked up the ladder in traditional functions. But if you're someone who doesn't have (and won't have the opportunity to get) a PhD in computer vision from a leading university in the world, then be very weary of taking advice from someone who does at face value - at least without being very aware of how to adapt it to your situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ee7xuq/beware_of_taking_advice_from_people_coming_from_a/,Beware of taking advice from people coming from a fundamentally different background,,416,88,0.95

i9kztq,MachineLearning,1597407954.0,"Hey everyone, I’ve seen a lot of resource sharing on this subreddit over the past couple of years. Threads like the [Advanced Courses Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fdw0ax/d_advanced_courses_update/) and this [RL thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/h940xb/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_about_reinforcement/) have been great to learn about new courses.

I'm currently working on a project to curate the currently massive number of ML resources, and I noticed that there are courses like CS231n or David Silver's that come up repeatedly (for a good reason). But there seems to be lots of other quality resources that don't receive as much widespread appreciation.

So, here are a few **hidden gems** that, imo, deserve more love:

**Causal Inference**

* [Duke Causal Inference bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModUPowerfulConceptsinSocialScience/playlists) (2015): Over 100 videos to understand ideas like counterfactuals, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity etc. Imo, the most approachable and complete videos series on Causal Inference (although it's definitely rooted in an Economics perspective rather than CS/ML, i.e. a lot closer to Gary King's work than Bernhard Schölkopf's).
* [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference) (2017): A textbook that introduces the reader to causality and some of its connections to ML. 200 pages of content on the cause-effect problem, multivariate causal models, hidden variables, time series and more. Alternatively, this [4-part lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo&t=1296s) by Peters goes through a lot of the same topics from the book. And for a more up-to-date survey of Causality x ML, Schölkopf's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10500) will be your best bet.
* [MLSS Africa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC722CmQVgcLtxt_jXr3RyWg/videos) (2019): Beyond a collection of other great talks, this Machine Learning Summer School has recorded tutorials on Causal Discovery by Bernhard Schölkopf and Causal Inference in Everyday ML by Ferenc Huszár. For an even more recent causality tutorial by Schölkopf, head to this year's virtual MLSS [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBOgpkDhQuYeVVjuzS5Wtxw/videos).
* [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiiOj5GSES6uw21kfXnxj3A/videos) (2020-present): For a collection of talks on current research, check out this virtual seminar. Talks by researchers like Andrew Gelman, Caroline Uhler or Ya Xu will give you an overview of the frontiers of causal inference in both industry and academia.

&#x200B;

**Computer Vision**

* [UW The Ancient Secrets of CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjMXczUzEYcHvw5YYSU92WrY8IwhTuq7p) (2018): Created by the first author of YOLO, this is likely the most well-rounded computer vision course as it not only teaches you the deep learning side of CV but  ""older"" methods like SIFT and optical flow as well.
* [UMichigan Deep Learning for CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) (2019): An evolution of the beloved CS231n, this course is taught by one of its former head instructors Justin Johnson. Similar in many ways, the UMichigan version is more up-to-date and includes lectures on Transformers, 3D and video + Colab/PyTorch homework.
* [TUM Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLog3nOPCjKBnjhuHMIXu4ISE4Z4f2jm39) (2020): This course is great for anyone who has already taken an intro CV or DL course and wants to explore ideas like neural rendering, interpretability and GANs further. Taught by Laura Leal-Taixé and Matthias Niessner.
* [MIT Vision Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMiFkFyfcNnZs6iwYLPI9g) (2020-present): A bunch of recorded videos of vision researchers giving talks on their current projects and thoughts. Devi Parikh's talk on language, vision and applications of ML in creative pursuits as well as Matthias Niessner's talk on Yuval Bahat's talk on explorable super resolution and some of its potential applications were quite fun.

&#x200B;

**Deep Learning**

* [Stanford Analyses/Theories of Deep Learning](https://stats385.github.io/lecture_videos) (2017 & 2019): This one was mentioned in the Advanced course thread, but only linked to the 2017 videos. Whether ML from a robustness perspective, overparameterization of neural nets or deep learning through random matrix theory, Stats 385 has a myriad of fascinating talks on theoretical deep learning. It's a shame most of these fantastic lectures only have a few hundred views.
* [Princeton IAS' Workshops](https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/sycoe) (2019-2020): The Institute for Advanced Study has held a series of workshops on matters such as new directions in ML as part of its Special Year on Optimization, Statistics and Theoretical Machine Learning. Most of these wonderful talks can be found on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/videosfromIAS/videos).
* [TUM Intro to DL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ8Y4kIIbzy_OaXv86lfbQwPHSomk2o2e) (2020): If the advanced CV course is a bit too difficult for you, this course (taught by the same professors) is the corresponding prerequisite course you can take prior to starting the advanced version.
* [MIT Embodied Intelligence Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXGbvgu9071i3koFooncAw/videos) (2020-ongoing): Similar to MIT's Vision Seminar, but organized by MIT's embodied intelligence group. Oriol Vinyal's talk on Deep Learning toolkit was really neat as it was basically a bird's eye view of Deep Learning and its different submodules.

&#x200B;

**Graphs**

* [Stanford Machine Learning with Graphs](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-videos-2019/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): The course was also mentioned in the Advanced course thread, but only linked to the slides. While some of the lectures sporadically appear on YouTube, if you simply go to the above website, you can just download every lecture. It covers topics like networks, data mining and graph neural networks. Taught by Jure Leskovec and Michele Catasta.
* [CMU Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZgVqqHOumTqxIhcdcpOAJOOimrRCGZn&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2020): If you want to learn more about PGMs, this course is the way to go. From the basics of graphical models to approximate inference to deep generative models, RL, causal inference and applications, it covers a lot of ground for just one course. Taught by Eric Xing.

&#x200B;

**ML Engineering**

* [Stanford Massive Computational Experiments, Painlessly](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Massive-Computational-Experiments-Painlessly?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2018): Did you ever feel confused about cluster computing, containers or scaling experiments in the cloud? Then this is the right place for you. As indicated by the name, you’ll come out of the course with a much better understanding of cloud computing, distributed tools and research infrastructure.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): This course is basically a bootcamp to learn best practices for your ML projects. From infrastructure to data management to model debugging to deployment, if there is one course you need to take to become a better ML Engineer, this is it.

&#x200B;

**Robotics**

* [QUT Robot Academy](https://robotacademy.net.au/?utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2017): A lot of robotics material online is concerned with the software side of the field, whereas this course (taught by Peter Corke) will teach you more about the basics of body dynamics, kinematics and joint control. Complementary resources that dive deeper into these concepts are [Kevin Lynch's 6-part MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics#courses) (2017) and [corresponding book](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/2/25/MR-v2.pdf) (2019) on robot motion, kinematics, dynamics, planning, control and manipulation.
* [MIT Underactuated Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkx8KyIQkMfVG-tWyV3CcQbon0Mh5zYaj&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): In this course Russ Tedrake will teach you about nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems from a computational perspective. Throughout the lectures and readings you will apply newly acquired knowledge through problems expressed in the context of differential equations, ML, optimization, robotics and programming.
* [UC Berkeley Advanced Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjNBPJdt8WamRAt4XKc639wF&utm_campaign=OpenMLU%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2019): With a bigger focus on ML, Pieter Abbeel guides you through the foundations of MDPs, Motion Planning, Particle Filters, Imitation Learning, Physics Simulations and many other topics. Particularly recommended to anyone with an interest in RL x Robotics.
* [Robotics Today Seminar](https://roboticstoday.github.io/) (2020-ongoing): An ongoing series of technical talks by various Robotics researchers. Particularly recommend the talks by Anca Dragan on optimizing intended reward functions and Scott Kuindersma on Boston Dynamics' recent progress on Atlas.

va0p9u,MachineLearning,1654963691.0,"Hello! I build some sex position classifiers using state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning! The best results were achieved by combining three input streams: RGB, Skeleton, and Audio. The current top accuracy is 75%. This would certainly be improved with a larger dataset.

Basically, human action recognition (HAR) is applied to the adult content domain. It presents some technical difficulties, especially due to the enormous variation in camera position (the challenge is to classify actions based on a single video).

The main input stream is the RGB one (as opposed to the skeleton one) and this is mostly due to the relatively small dataset (\~44hrs). It is difficult to get an accurate pose estimation (which is a prerequisite for building robust skeleton-HAR models) for most of the videos due to the proximity of the human bodies in the frames. Hence there simply weren't enough data to include all the positions in the skeleton-based model.

The audio input stream on the other hand is only used for a handful of actions, where deriving some insight is possible.

Check it out on Github for a detailed description: [https://github.com/rlleshi/phar](https://github.com/rlleshi/phar)

Possible use-cases include:

2. Automatic tag generator

skjjvm,MachineLearning,1643996930.0,"One of the problems with real world machine learning is that engineers often treat models as pure black boxes to be optimized, ignoring the datasets behind them. I've often worked with ML engineers who can't give you any examples of false positives they want their models to fix!

Perhaps this is okay when your datasets are high-quality and representative of the real world, but they're usually not.

For example, many toxicity and hate speech datasets mistakenly flag texts like ""this is fucking awesome!"" as toxic, even though they're actually quite positive -- because NLP datasets are often labeled by non-fluent speakers who pattern match on profanity. (So is 99% accuracy or 99% precision actually a good thing? Not if your test sets are inaccurate as well!)

Many of the new, massive scale language models use the Perspective API to measure their safety. But we've noticed a number of Perspective API mistakes on texts containing positive profanity, so [I wrote a blog post](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/are-popular-toxicity-models-simply-profanity-detectors) in an attempt to explain the problem and quantify it.

* Focuses on mathematical proof
* Provides detailed overview of methods and describes the limitations and conditions of each test (e.g. What is the description of Chi-Square test? Interpretation of ANOVA test values? Circumstances and underlying conditions needed for each of the methods of hypothesis testing?)

bl7abw,MachineLearning,1557115433.0,"MIT neuroscientists have performed the most rigorous testing yet of computational models that mimic the brain’s visual cortex.

Using their current best model of the brain’s visual neural network, the researchers designed a new way to precisely control individual neurons and populations of neurons in the middle of that network. In an animal study, the team then showed that the information gained from the computational model enabled them to create images that strongly activated specific brain neurons of their choosing.

The findings suggest that the current versions of these models are similar enough to the brain that they could be used to control brain states in animals. The study also helps to establish the usefulness of these vision models, which have generated vigorous debate over whether they accurately mimic how the visual cortex works, says James DiCarlo, the head of MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, an investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines, and the senior author of the study.

Up until recently, I had my hands in a bunch of different things as “the data guy” - running reports, automating processes, etc. It wasn’t much, but it was honest work.

[Unrolled Summary](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1088679404937625600.html):

[How can you do great AI research when you don't have access to google-scale compute?](https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1088679404937625600) By being weird.

The big tech companies are obsessed with staying nimble despite being big, and some succeed to some extent. But they can't afford to be as weird as a lone looney professor.

A lone professor with a handful of students and a few computers can never win over DeepMind or FAIR in a straight competition. But we can afford to try methods that make absolutely no sense, or attack problems that nobody wants to solve as they don't look like problems.

To the extent I've done anything useful or worthwhile in my career, it's always been through trying to solve a problem nobody thought of, or trying a method that shouldn't work. Very often the useful/publishable end result was nothing like what I thought I was working towards.

So go on, be weird. Out-weird the giants. Even if they're both nimble and powerful, they cannot be as stupid and ridiculous as you. Because how would that look? To managers, investors, board members, the general public? You can afford to completely disregard such entities.

Now, I'm not saying that there's no value in throwing giant compute resources at some problem, and trying to break a long-standing benchmark. That's all good, I'm happy that there are people that do those things. But I'm happy that I don't have to do it. Because it's a bit boring

And of course the advantage of the big tech companies is not only in having many GPUs. It's also in having large teams of highly competent people working on the project non-stop without having to e.g. teach or go to faculty meetings. Still, you can do it.

Many of the best ideas still come from academia, even though the best results don't.

Due to having to do machine learning on a laptop and having 100 million records, I took a random sample of the data (or more accurately only 1% because that's all my laptop can handle). I proceeded to do EDA, train data and fit a few models that looked well fitting.

This is retail data and my interviewer immediately told me that my random sample approach is wrong. He said that I should have taken a few stores at random and then used ALL their data (as in full data for all the stores picked) to train the models. According to him, you can't train the model unless you have every single data point for a store. I think that he doesn't seem to understand the concept of random sampling.

I actually think both approaches are reasonable, but that his claim of needing every single data point for a store or you are not getting the ""full picture"" is incorrect.

I failed the challenge due to this issue and that was literally the only thing that was wrong with my solution (according to feedback I asked for) :(

gwibmc,datascience,1591280367.0,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

ok5xpq,datascience,1626274296.0,"There was an earlier [discussion about career paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ojobxx/what_are_the_typical_stages_in_a_data_science/), and in writing a reply I ended up writing an entire post, so I figured I would post it as such.

The topic of conversation was ""what is harder to replace: a strong individual contributor or a good manager?"".

Personally, I think they're both equally hard to replace assuming we're comparing apples to apples (e.g., if we're talking about the expert with 20 years of experience, then we should be comparing them to an SVP of DS with 20 years experience).

u/jturp-sc then mentioned that people often undervalue the contribution of managers. Which I think is true of a lot of individual contributors. That is, they see their managers as purely paper pushers, and they tend to greatly underestimate the effort that seemingly simple things like project managent take.

I like to use the following analogy:

When in college, I played in a rec soccer league with a bunch of friends, including my two roommates.

Roommate number 1 was the typical forward - fast, great shot, *loved* to have the ball, loved to score, loved to brag about scoring. Was altogether a very strong player.

Roommate number 2 was the opposite. Low key guy, didn't have a great shot, wasn't very fast. On paper, not a great soccer player. But he had really good vision and was a really good passer.

The last season before roommate 2 left the team we lost one game and played in the finals.

The first season after roommate 2 lef the team we lost all but 1 game. Literally everyone was playing worse. People were getting frustrated at how bad we were playing, so they were making bad decisions and making it even worse.

No one talked about it, but I actually reached out to former roommate and told him - ""dude, without you, we're lost. I never appreciated how much value you brought to this team, but it's so easy to see now"".

Because his job was to create opporuntities. Sure, you still need other people to capitalize on the opportunities, but someone needs to create them first.

In soccer, it means that for a forward to score, someone needs to get them the ball either close to the goal with an open look, or in stride and in space against a single defender. Sure, every once in a while a forward will take on 2-3 guys and score anyway, but that is not a recipe for success - that ends up being more luck than anything. Moreover, for you to win games you need to stop the other team from scoring more goals than your forwards can score. So while your forward may get all the glory in a 1-0 win, what people often forget is that your defense and goalie had to keep that ""0"" intact.

In data science, it means that for a data scientist to build and deploy a model (i.e., to capitalize), *and for the organization to realize and recognize the value of said model*, someone needs to create the opportunity. Someone needs to argue that the model should be built in the first place - that there is a real business problem that can be tackled with data science. Someone needs to get it to the top of the priority queue - convincing leadership that the model should be worked on *now* instead of a different problem. Someone needs to get business stakeholders, IT, software development, etc., to commit time and resources to support the project. And then someone needs to take a good model and cram it down people's throats until they agree to use it.

Not only that, someone needs to make sure that your team doesn't get flooded with shitty request. Someone also needs to make sure that you are constantly advocating for people to get paid market value, to continue to add headcount, to avoid taking on too much tech debt, to have the organization invest in resources, etc.

For the first 2 years of my career as an individual contributor, I was never aware of 90% of that stuff that my boss was doing. At some point I became her right-hand person, and that's when she started sharing some of the things that I didn't get to see. The hour-long meeting to get software to allocate 1/8th of a resource to do QA for one of our projects. The one hour meeting with IT to get us time on the big-ass server to run a simulation that was going to take 1 week and was due in 8 days. The 2-hour meeting with product development about why we can't do the equivalent of reversing physics to deliver on the dumb-ass idea that a salesperson sold to a client. The days/weeks worth of legwork to get us an additional hire approved. The 6-8 standing weekly meetings on her calendar.

All of the sudden I realized ""she is spending 80% of her time doing the things I didn't even know existed, and 20% of her time doing the things I thought were her full time job"".

I also got close with one of our expert data scientists. Great guy - 20 years of experience, a walking statistics encyclopedia, and incredibly nice (to anyone who wasn't an idiot). Do you know what shocked me? The level of respect that he had for the people who weren't in an expert role. He had been around for 20 years, and had gotten to see people like my boss do all the dirty work for him. He got to show up and do the things he enjoyed doing - but he know that the reason for that was that other people in the building were having to go eat shit sandwiches with a smile to keep the operation rolling.

We had two experts who had the opporuntity (more than once) to take over the department and become VP. They both passed. I presume they both laughed first, then passed.

Which one is more valuable? I honestly don't know. I honestly don't think it makes sense to try to establish who is more valuable - you need them both. If you're going to build a world-class (or even good) data science team, you need to have both types. You need to have the people who have a mathematical 6th gear that they can tap into. But you also need the people who have 4-wheel drive and can go 10mph over a swamp.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ok5xpq/why_managers_matter/,Why Managers matter?,,404,102,0.98
l7q12x,datascience,1611918680.0,"Mid/Late 2020 I applied for a job. A Sr position in a data eng. related field in a digital services global corporation. The job not only looked good because of the tasks, but also because the service offered by this company is specially interesting for me, and is something I am passionate about. So, I decided to go for it, big time.

After 2 screenings, one pure HHRR and another semi technical, hands on trivial challenge, I was invited for the \*big\* technical case round. As I am also working full time and I wanted to make it perfect, I took 1 week off to prepare the case. I applied all I know, and more, I really put a lot of effort and went the extra mile in every detail. Then, the interview/presentation took place. 2:30 hrs. with 4 interviewers, code discussion, modelling, engineering details, deployment... The presentation was perfect, not only the best I have ever done, but also the best I have seen -I also interviewed people since the early 2000s, and I've seen it all. 20 minutes after the presentation, the leading person -my potential future boss- called me to congratulate me for the outcome and confirm I was going to have the last rounds ASAP.

For the last round I spent my whole holidays preparing everything I could think of, and also understanding the profiles of the people I was going to talk to. The last round was a series of more informal chats with top management profiles, all of them went perfectly, good vibes, nice chats, and I was able to cast some light over challenges they face in their business and propose how to tackle them.

Again, soon my potential future boss called me and let me know that everything went perfect and that I should expect news very soon. We also discussed when I could join, home office situation, the profiles of my potential team, etc...

And that's it.

\+9 weeks passed, I never got any further feedback of any kind. After 1 week I sent a short email, nothing. 2 weeks later, a second one, CCing the HHRR partner involved. Nothing. At some point 2-3 weeks later sent a last short email, and nothing. Complete silence. Nothing. I just stopped trying.

I was interviewed by 7, 8 people, I spent weeks on preparation and did an excellent job. I spend +7 hours in interviews. Why do they do this? I do take it personally, this is not only a frustration considering the job, but also a personal insult.

How is this even possible?

Sorry, I needed to vent.

EDIT. Thanks for all the feedback. Some comments are really interesting and considerate. Just a comment: the reason I am -or was- \*devastated\* (!) was the **ghosting**, not the fact that I did not get the job. I know there are multiple factors I do not control in a process, and that´s fine, is part of the game and I get it. But the ghosting is something that I just can´t cope with. I think it´s rude, unprofessional, unnecessary and simply stupid.

I finished undergrad this past spring and just got a chance to tidy up my undergraduate thesis. It's about manifold learning, which is not discussed too often here, so I thought some people might enjoy it.

It's a math thesis, but it's designed to be broadly accessible (e.g. the first few chapters could serve as an introduction to kernel learning). It might also help some of the undergrads here looking for thesis topics -- there seem to be posts about this every few weeks or so.

Here I will focus on six false and/or misleading attributions of credit to Dr. Hinton in the press release of the 2019 Honda Prize [[HON]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#HON).

**Executive Summary.** Hinton has made significant contributions to artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, but Honda credits him for fundamental inventions of others whom he did not cite. Science must not allow corporate PR to distort the academic record. **[Sec. I:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I)** Modern [backpropagation](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html) was created by Linnainmaa (1970), not by Rumelhart & Hinton & Williams (1985). Ivakhnenko's deep feedforward nets (since 1965) learned internal representations long before Hinton's shallower ones (1980s). **[Sec. II:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II)** Hinton's unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs in the 2000s was conceptually a rehash of [my unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html) in 1991\. And it was irrelevant for the [deep learning revolution of the early 2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html) which was mostly based on supervised learning - twice my lab [spearheaded the shift from unsupervised pre-training to pure supervised learning](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) (1991-95 and 2006-11). **[Sec. III:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III)** The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition was based on two methods from my lab: [LSTM](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006). Hinton et al. (2012) still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s, and did not compare it to the revolutionary CTC-LSTM ([which was soon on most smartphones](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html)). **[Sec. IV:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#IV)** Our group at IDSIA had [superior award-winning computer vision through deep learning (2011)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html) before Hinton's (2012). **[Sec. V:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V)** Hanson (1990) had a variant of ""dropout"" long before Hinton (2012). **[Sec. VI:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#VI)** In the [2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html), most major AI-based services across the world [(speech recognition, language translation, etc.) on billions of devices](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html) were mostly based on our deep learning techniques, not on Hinton's. Repeatedly, Hinton [omitted](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#conclusion) references to fundamental prior art (Sec. [I](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I) & [II](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II) & [III](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III) & [V](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V)) [[DL1]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL1) [[DL2]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DL2) [[DLC]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#DLC) [[MIR]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#MIR) [[R4-R8]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#R4).

**Open Review:** [https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX)

**Abstract:**

Adaptive optimization methods such as AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam have been proposed to achieve a rapid training process with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. Though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly compared with SGD or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning rates. Recent work has put forward some algorithms such as AMSGrad to tackle this issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing methods. In our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to poor performance. We provide new variants of Adam and AMSGrad, called AdaBound and AMSBound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to achieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to SGD and give a theoretical proof of convergence. We further conduct experiments on various popular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work. Experimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD and maintain higher learning speed early in training at the same time. Moreover, they can bring significant improvement over their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks. The implementation of the algorithm can be found at [https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound](https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound).

**Some updates:**

Thanks a lot for all your comments! Here're some updates to address some of the common concerns.

About tasks, datasets, models. As suggested by many of you, as well as the reviewers, it would be great to test AdaBound on more datasets, and larger datasets, with more models. But very unfortunately I only have limited computational resources. It is almost impossible for me to conduct experiments on some large benchmarks like ImageNet. :( It would be so nice of you if you may have a try with AdaBound and tell me its shortcomings or bugs! It would be important for improvements on AdaBound as well as possible further work.

I believe there is no silver bullet in the field of CS. It doesn't mean that you will be free from tuning hyperparameters once using AdaBound. The performance of a model depends on so many things including the task, the model structure, the distribution of data, and etc. You still need to decide what hyperparameters to use based on your specific situation, but you may probably use much less time than before!

&#x200B;

It was my first time doing research on optimization methods. As this is a project by a literally freshman to this field and an undergrad, I believe AdaBound is well required further improvements. I will try my best to make it better. Thanks again for all your constructive comments!

They are still working with raw data from the source systems. Many of the reporting needs and BI Task can be accomplished without using traditional data science models. Simple tools in Excel or PowerBI will do the trick many times especially when statistics come into play.

105v7el,MachineLearning,1673114387.0," Greg Yang is a mathematician and AI researcher at Microsoft Research who for the past several years has done incredibly original theoretical work in the understanding of large artificial neural networks. His work currently spans the following five papers:

Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)  
Tensor Programs II: Neural Tangent Kernel for Any Architecture: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548)  
Tensor Programs III: Neural Matrix Laws: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685)  
Tensor Programs IV: Feature Learning in Infinite-Width Neural Networks: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html)  
Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466)

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"". The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

I am proud to share with you the first version of a project on a geometric unification of deep learning that has kept us busy throughout COVID times (having started in February 2020).

We release our 150-page ""proto-book"" on geometric deep learning (with Michael Bronstein, Joan Bruna and Taco Cohen)! We have currently released the arXiv preprint and a companion blog post at:

[https://geometricdeeplearning.com/](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/)

Through the lens of symmetries, invariances and group theory, we attempt to distill ""all you need to build the neural architectures that are all you need"". All the 'usual suspects' such as CNNs, GNNs, Transformers and LSTMs are covered, while also including recent exciting developments such as Spherical CNNs, SO(3)-Transformers and Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs.

Hence, we believe that our work can be a useful way to navigate the increasingly challenging landscape of deep learning architectures. We hope you will find it a worthwhile perspective!

I also recently gave a virtual talk at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg (the birthplace of Felix Klein's ""Erlangen Program"", which was one of our key guiding principles!) where I attempt to distill the key concepts of the text within a \~1 hour slot:

c1vxoc,MachineLearning,1560820798.0,"I've been trying to get back into a more ML/science based role (currently I'm more on the tech business side). Within my own specific domain, I know all of the major algorithms and have been able to shine in that particular topic (times series and regression models). When it comes to generic data science, I have been able to handle myself quite well on most fronts (probability questions, conceptual questions, what is the central mean theorem? can you explain MLE? etc...) .

One topic kept coming up though, with 15 out of the 17 interviewers, across all 5 companies (including two of the biggest names in tech) asking this exact question:

**Suppose you have a binary classifier (logistic regression, neural net, etc...), how do you handle imbalanced data sets in production?**

I don't know :-( . I know that you need to be careful with which metric you use to evaluate your model, that you should look at precision and recall or the ROC, instead of just accuracy. And that your sampling strategies should change to better reflect each class. But all of this is during training.

Once in production, I know that you face a catch-22 situation:

* If you *don't skew* your training data, then you don't have enough data from the sparse class for the classifier to learn something, and it will just learn to always predict the dense class.
* If you *do skew* your data, then now you're facing a situation where the distribution of the training data and the distribution of the production data are completely different, so your model won't predict well (at least my understanding is that different distributions in test and in prod is always a recipe for disaster).

Is my assessment of the dilemma correct? And how do you solve it?

Why is this question so popular (FWIW - none of these companies were doing medical or security applications....)

&#x200B;

Some follow up questions and/or hints that were given (but I still couldn't really answer the question in a satisfactory way):

* If this is the case, but only you noticed that your binary classifier is not performing well only after you have already deployed it in production and had been scoring it for a few weeks, what do you do? (My answer, go back to training, and either re-evaluate which features you want to use, or find more data to train on) , second follow from the same person: What if I told you that you are stuck with the same model and couldn't get any more data, what do you do then (I answered: l1 or l2 regularization? but these are applicable to any data set, they aren't specific to imbalanced data. Fiddle with the K in your K-fold CV? that wouldn't work either -- by this point I felt like I was being Kobayashi Marued...)
* Can you adjust your classifier after training, but before deploying it, so that it is adjusted to the original distribution, not the skewed (downsampled or upsampled) distribution you used during training? (Drew a blank - as far as I know, any adjustment to the model based on knowledge prior to deployment constitutes training in one form or the other....)

With regards to the second question, I did come across \[this thread and the blog that it linked to\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649)) .

l4zbd9,datascience,1611613636.0,"**TL;DR** I've been a Data Scientist for 6 years now and with time I've grown quite bored and disillusioned with it, and I wanted to figure out if it has happened to anyone else or I'm kinda weird :)

Fellow Data Scientists,

I have a very unusual question to ask you. 

I originally got into the Data and Analytics space working in Operations Research for a large ecommerce and logistic company. From there I became a Data Analyst for a successful mobile app and then a Data Scientist for a boutique consulting company. I currently work on building and deploying ML models for large clients on the Azure ecosystem. I also volunteer as a Project Manager for a Data charity. I basically experienced it all.

Education-wise, I have a MSc in Industrial Engineering and Management with a specialisation in Operations Research / Mathematical Optimisation, and a MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from a top university in the UK, both degrees awareded with Distinction. I also co-authored 7 research papers on ML in journals and conferences.

Sounds like a great career, doesn't it? Actually, I never truly enjoyed it despite Data Science is such a ""cool"" career on paper.

The things that bother me are:

1. I feel I am neither meat nor fish. Not technically skilled enough to be a Software Developer and being more involved in the development of the key features of the product, nor soft skilled enough to play a pivotal role with the Product / Business / Operations Management team.
2. I've experienced how difficult is for a Data Scientist to change career path within an organisation. My experience has always been that people who don't have our background tend to see us like curious animals who only love to play with data and to code, and as a result of that we tend to be pigeonholed into our roles and discarded if any interesting opportunities arise within other departments of the company, despite our Subject Matter Expertise, excitement for the product / business and any soft skills we might have.
3. I've noticed how DSs are almost never recognised and praised by the company's leadership team for their work, as opposed to Business Managers, PMs, SWEs, Marketing Managers and Designers.
4. I miss the ""tangible"" outcome of my work. For most of the day I sit (often lonely) producing code, but I cannot touch nor see the output of my code, and that's frustrating because I feel that I cannot share my achievements with others including my family. I think that if I were a Civil Engineer or even a Software Developer I feel I could feel way more excited about what I produce.

I am not looking for advice on how to mitigate my circumnstances, at the end of the day I've decided that I will retrain myself in the field of Chemical or Sustainable Energy Engineering to overcome this disappointment and work on more ""meaningful"" projects, and if I could go back in time I'd not get into Data Science again. But I wanted to ask if you (or someone you know) have ever felt the same sense of disillusionment, or is it just me (I've asked a few DSs in person and no one has felt like this - apart for not being praised properly).

At first, we were unable to reproduce their results until we noticed that a large number of these studies had one thing in common: they used over-sampling to mitigate the imbalance in the data (more term than preterm cases). After discovering this, we were able to reproduce their results, but only when making a fundamental methodological flaw: applying over-sampling before partitioning data into training and testing set. In this work, we highlight why applying over-sampling before data partitioning results in overly optimistic results and reproduce the results of all studies we suspected of making that mistake. Moreover, we study the impact of over-sampling, when applied correctly.

abj1mc,MachineLearning,1546357237.0,"Hello,

I spent a good part of today reading on why deep neural networks are able to generalize well.  Based on my reading, I have made some notes. I'm new to this, so I'd appreciate if I can have community members' comments / discussion on the same. In particular, I'd love to know if I got something wrong or if someone is aware of a significant result that I missed.

Here are my notes:

1/ First major insight was that the minibatch of data for gradient descent actually helps in generalization on unseen data.   **Gradients of minibatch of data that are specific about that batch cancel over multiple runs and what remains is gradients that are generally applicable**.

2/ It is known that [neural networks are universal function approximators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). That is, given a function they can approximate that function with arbitrary accuracy.  But now I think that's not an interesting result (of approximating a function). Even a database can do that. What's interesting is that they give good answers on *unseen* data.

3/ It is a mystery how that happens but probably the answer lies in not as much about neural networks but the types of datasets we have in the natural world and what problems we use neural networks for.

4/ Natural world is full of information, one 1000x1000 px photo has 1 million bits but when we see it, we either see it as a cat or a dog.  Effectively, we ""throw out"" a lot of information to do whatever we want to do. To classify a photo, our brain convert a log(2^(1) million) bits into log(2^(1)) bit and the task of a neural network is to find the mapping that ""forgets"" or ""throws"" all the information irrelevant to the task while only retaining info that's useful to us.

5/ Since this log(2^(1) million) to log(2^(1)) is a many-to-one function, neural networks might be a really good model for approximating these functions.  **Different layers might be throwing away irrelevant information while keeping only the relevant info**.

6/ This is suggested by two papers/videos I saw today.  One was on information bottleneck: [https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/)

7/ The other one is how **errors introduced in early layers tend to vanish in higher layers**: [http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/)

8/ In effect, **neural networks are lossy compression algorithms** that compress inputs as much as they can while retaining as much info as possible about the task at hand (classification, prediction)  This helps networks generalize as data-specific noise gets ignored in deep networks.

9/ Okay, so we know what deep networks \*might\* be doing but the question is how training via gradient descent is able to find the right set of parameters that do this compression.  Given the millions of weights and biases, it seems the problem is of finding the needle in the haystack.

10/ I honestly don't know and research community also (probably) doesn't know. But there are hints.  One is related to the earlier suggestion of many-to-one mapping of input to output in real-world tasks. This means that t**here may be more than 1 set of parameters that do the job equally well**

11/ So stochastic gradient descent might not be finding the ""perfect"" set of parameters but it may not matter. **The problem we want to solve through neural networks may get solved by many sets of params** and SGD may find one of them.

12/ In fact, empirically the landscape of **loss function for neural networks on ""natural"" problems (of image classification, etc.) seems to have a ""flat"" minima.**

&#x200B;

[Image via: https://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](https://i.redd.it/91ysxtolzt721.png)

13/ So the *same* function we're seeking might be parameterized by many parameters.   On top of this, what helps is that **in a big deep network there exist many, many subnetworks. And, just by pure luck, one or more of them might be better positioned to seek that landscape via SGD.** This is explored in the lottery hypothesis: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)

14/ I understand how the width of the network may help in exploring what information to throw (by setting weights to zero) and what information to use, but I'm not sure the role of depth.  **My hunch says the utility of depth is related to how stochastic gradient descent works. Do you agree?**

15/ Perhaps, just perhaps, different layers (depth) helps SGD reduce loss in steps by focusing on few dimensions at once v/s if it is just one very wide layer, SGD has too many dimensions to seek at once.  But I don't really know.

16/ What's fascinating to me is the how easily researchers drop neural networks as function approximators anywhere and everywhere. This just makes it more worthwhile to study the dynamics of deep networks.  If you want to dive in, here's a great tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj\_puQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj_puQ)

That's all! Did I miss anything? Did I go wrong somewhere? I'd appreciate any inputs that can help build us a better intuition of what might be happening under the hood.

PS: I tweeted about this as well, but I don't have many friends on Twitter who may provide a perspective on my notes or catch my errors.  That's why I started a discussion on this subreddit.

>**Abstract:** Multiplying matrices is among the most fundamental and compute-intensive operations in machine learning. Consequently, there has been significant work on efficiently approximating matrix multiplies. We introduce a learning-based algorithm for this task that greatly outperforms existing methods. Experiments using hundreds of matrices from diverse domains show that it often runs 100× faster than exact matrix products and 10× faster than current approximate methods. In the common case that one matrix is known ahead of time, our method also has the interesting property that it requires zero multiply-adds. These results suggest that a mixture of hashing, averaging, and byte shuffling−the core operations of our method−could be a more promising building block for machine learning than the sparsified, factorized, and/or scalar quantized matrix products that have recently been the focus of substantial research and hardware investment.

Uber AI started as an acquisition of Geometric Intelligence, which was founded in October 2014 by three professors: Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist from NYU, also well-known as an author; Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor of machine learning and Fellow of the Royal Society; Kenneth Stanley, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Florida and pioneer in evolutionary approaches to machine learning; and Douglas Bemis, a recent NYU graduate with a PhD in neurolinguistics. Other team members included Noah Goodman (Stanford), Jeff Clune (Wyoming) and Jason Yosinski (a recent graduate of Cornell).

I would like to use this post as an opportunity for redditors to mention any work done by Uber AI that they feel deserves recognition. Any work mentioned here ([https://eng.uber.com/research/?\_sft\_category=research-ai-ml](https://eng.uber.com/research/?_sft_category=research-ai-ml)) or here ([https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/](https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/)) is fair game.

* [Welcoming the Era of Deep Neuroevolution](https://eng.uber.com/deep-neuroevolution/)
* [The surprising creativity of digital evolution: A collection of anecdotes from the evolutionary computation and artificial life research communities](https://eng.uber.com/research/the-surprising-creativity-of-digital-evolution-a-collection-of-anecdotes-from-the-evolutionary-computation-and-artificial-life-research-communities/)

* [Kenneth Stanley's Lecture on On Creativity, Objectives, and Open-Endedness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2I4E_UINRo)
* Also, here's a summary by an outside source: [https://analyticsindiamag.com/uber-ai-labs-layoffs/](https://analyticsindiamag.com/uber-ai-labs-layoffs/) (I found it amusing that they quoted u/hardmaru quoting me).

One reason why I find this research fascinating is encapsulated in the quote below:

""Right now, the majority of the field is engaged in what I call the manual path to AI. In the first phase, which we are in now, everyone is manually creating different building blocks of intelligence. The assumption is that at some point in the future our community will finish discovering all the necessary building blocks and then will take on the Herculean task of putting all of these building blocks together into an extremely complex thinking machine. That might work, and some part of our community should pursue that path. However, I think a faster path that is more likely to be successful is to rely on learning and computation: the idea is to create an algorithm that itself designs all the building blocks and figures out how to put them together, which I call an AI-generating algorithm. Such an algorithm starts out not containing much intelligence at all and bootstraps itself up in complexity to ultimately produce extremely powerful general AI. That’s what happened on Earth.  The simple Darwinian algorithm coupled with a planet-sized computer ultimately produced the human brain. I think that it’s really interesting and exciting to think about how we can create algorithms that mimic what happened to Earth in that way. Of course, we also have to figure out how to make them work so they do not require a planet-sized computer."" - [Jeff Clune](https://eng.uber.com/jeff-clune-interview/)

As time's gone by, I still do the occasional search to try and find some article that explains a difficult or complex issue but I'm getting the impression that these sites are getting absolutely swamped by extremely low quality articles and it's effectively ruining any usefulness they once had.

Generally, I'm finding the bulk of them fall into one of two categories: 1) An extremely shallow explanation of something or 2) A far too complex explanation that isn't suitable for someone who generally understands DS but not this particular concept. To me, both of these suggest that the author doesn't really know what they're talking about and are essentially just regurgitating content they've found elsewhere.

it strikes me that a lot of the authors I see are students who're basically attempting to drive clicks through clickbait type titles in some effort to boost their reputation or CV.

Am I being too harsh?

The vast majority of the articles I see these days seem to be by people who either don't have much understanding of the topic and/or don't have the ability to explain it well.

After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, junior data scientist in the South florida area, 80k a year (100k with performance bonuses plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 1 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame. As in add a variable from the other data sets to the customer one based on customer ID i.e create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration from the 4 other data sets.


Final DF was 1.5 million then had to filter by desired population, with all the filters the DF was only 35k observations and that's what I ran my models on.


It took about 6 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 3)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 4) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 5) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are manholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 6) confirmation call!


My degree was a bs in economics with a specialization in econometrics and a minor in stats! Top 40 school ranked nationally. Hope this helps anyone applying!


.

Edit: Well apparently this is considered a very rigorous process and I agree, I have other friends who got similar jobs with easier processes. However it's my first job right out of college (december grad) and I only had 1 year experience. Also with bonuses I can expect to make about 100k so I think it's fair.

w2dab2,datascience,1658186243.0,"I started self-teaching data science about 2.5 years ago, and recently got promoted to a data engineering role! Like a legit role at a reputable company.

I know this is a data science subreddit, but this is where it all started for me, so I figured I post here.

Just wanted to share, and hopefully help give some advice to anyone who might be looking for it. Here are some things I learned, definitely feel free to ask for more.

\- Data science is a huge industry. Learning SQL, Python, and statistics is only the beginning so that you can have a baseline level of skills that can be applied to parts of the data industry. I personally chose to go down an engineering path, but that was only after about a year of experience in the industry.

\- If you're trying to break into the industry, make sure to stay curious and learn REALLY hard. Breaking into an industry is not easy, although I think data science and tech are some of the careers where you definitely can self teach your way to success. You CAN do it without a degree, I've seen SOOO many people in the industry at good jobs who have self taught or done a bootcamp.

\- Set your expectations LOW for your first job salary and title. Depending on what your prior experience is, you may need to be flexible with the first job you get. Basically, apply for anything that allows you to practice SQL.

\- Engage with the community. Keep posting on reddit, stackoverflow, kaggle, whatever it is. Engaging with peers in the industry will help you gain exposure to new things and stay motivated.

\- There are tons of resources out there. Doing a bootcamp is always a great way to get started and get some guided help imo, then start learning on your own from there!

MIT, like most universities, has many courses on machine learning (6.036, 6.867, and many others). Those classes teach techniques to produce effective models for a given dataset, and the classes focus heavily on the mathematical details of models rather than practical applications. However, in real-world applications of ML, the dataset is not fixed, and focusing on improving the data often gives better results than improving the model. We’ve personally seen this time and time again in our applied ML work as well as our research.

Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging science that studies techniques to improve datasets in a systematic/algorithmic way — given that this topic wasn’t covered in the standard curriculum, we (a group of PhD candidates and grads) thought that we should put together a new class! We taught this intensive 2-week course in January over MIT’s IAP term, and we’ve just published all the course material, including lecture videos, lecture notes, hands-on lab assignments, and lab solutions, in hopes that people outside the MIT community would find these resources useful.

We’d be happy to answer any questions related to the class or DCAI in general, and we’d love to hear any feedback on how we can improve the course material.

j6uqn9,datascience,1602090302.0,"So i am working for a small/medium sized company with around 80 employees as Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer / you name it. There is no real differentiation. I have my own vm where i run ETL jobs and created a bunch of apis and set up a small UI which nobody uses except me lol. My tasks vary from data cleaning for external applications to performance monitoring of business KPIs, project management, creation of dashboards, A/B testing and modelling, tracking and even scraping our own website. I am mainly using Python for my ETL processes, PowerBI for Dashboards, SQL for... data?! and EXCEL. Lots of Excel and i want to emphasise on why Excel is so awesome (at least in my role, which is not well defined as i pointed out). My usual workflow is: i start with a python script where i merge the needed data (usually a mix of SQL and some csv's and xlsx), add some basic cleaning and calculate some basic KPIs (e.g. some multivariate Regression, some distribution indicators, some aggregates) and then.... EXCEL

So what do i like so much about Excel?

First: Everybody understands it!   
This is key when you dont have a team who all speak python and SQL. Excel is just a great communication Tool. You can show your rough spreadsheet in a Team meeting (especially good in virtual meetings) and show the others your idea and the potential outcome. You can make quick calculations and visuals based on questions and suggestions live. Everybody will be on the same page without going through abstract equations or code. I made the experience that its usually the specific cases that matter. Its that one row in your sheet which you go through from beginning to end and people will get it when they see the numbers. This way you can quickly interact with the skillset of your team and get useful information about possible flaws or enhancements of your first approach of the model.

Second: Scrolling is king!  
I often encounter the problem of developing very specific KPIs/ Indicators on a very very dirty dataset. I usually have a soffisticated idea on how the metric can be modelled but usually the results are messy and i dont know why. And no: its not just outliers :D There are so many business related factors that can play a role that are very difficult to have in mind all the time. Like what kind of distribution channel was used for the sales, was the item advertised, were vouchers used, where there problems with the ledger, the warehouse, .... the list goes on. So to get hold of the mess i really like scrolling data. And almost all the time i find simething that inspires me on how to improve my model, either by adding filters or just understanding the problem a little bit better. And Excel is in my opinion just the best tool for the task. Its just so easy to quickly format and filter your data in order to identify possible issues. I love pivoting in excel, its just awesome easy. And scrolling through the data gives me the feeling of beeing close to the things happening in the business. Its like beeing on the street and talking to the people :D

Third (and last): Mockups and mapping

In order to simulate edge cases of your model without writing unit-tests for which you dont have time, i find it very useful to create small mockup tables where you can test your idea. This is especially usieful for the development of features for your model. I often found that the feature that i was trying to extract did not behave in the way i intended. Sure you can quickly generate some random table in python but often random is not what you want. you want to test specific cases and see if the feature makes sense in that case.  
Then you have mapping of values or classes or whatever. Since excel is just so comfortable it is just the best for this task. I often encountered that mapping rules are very fuzzy defined in the business. Sometimes a bunch of stakeholders is involved and everybody just needs to check for themselves to see if their needs are represented. After the process is finished that map can go to SQL and eventually updates are done. But in that eary stage Excel is just the way to go.

Of course Excel is at the same time very limited and it is crucial to know its limits. There is a close limit of rows and columns that can be processed without hassle on an average computer. Its not supposed to be part of an ETL process. Things can easily go wrong.   
But it is very often the best starting point.

I hope you like Excel as much as me (and hate it at the same time) and if not: consider!

I also would be glad to hear if people have made similar experiences or prefer other tools.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j6uqn9/excel_is_gold/,Excel is Gold,Tooling,381,150,0.87

10vynlk,datascience,1675765897.0,"Don't want to give too much away, but I'm in my mid-20s and work as the only data scientist at a smallish (<100 people) startup. I'm in my second year in the role, and although I enjoyed my first year very much, I've noticed that I've really been not having a good time lately. There are a few reasons for this:

* I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.
* Our leadership doesn't really understand data analysis. The CEO is always asking for ""insights"" as if I can just comb through our database and magically come up with recommendations for how to improve the business. In short, because I'm the only person doing any sort of analysis, and our engineering team is pretty lean and doesn't particularly focus on data collection/integrity/etc., it can be hard to even get an analysis started (and I always have to push really hard to e.g. get engineering to set up the data tracking I need). When I have presented data analyses that I've done, I've noticed that the CEO only cares about findings that affirm what he already believes, which is really annoying because at that point, why should I even put in any effort?
* I have to do a lot of stuff that isn't really relevant to my role because I'm the only one who can do it. For example, our finance team relies on me for a lot of important reporting (e.g. when we are talking to investors), and I end up being the person who has to put together long financial reports (which isn't so bad) and audit/reconcile different metrics when they don't look right or don't match between sources (which is really quite terribly boring). To be fair, my job description does include making dashboards and reports, but it's gotten to the point where my day-to-day is often answering questions like ""why doesn't this number \[pulled from our prod database\] not match this other number \[displayed on some dashboard I know nothing about that was made by some random engineer\]"" or ""do we track \[x metric\] somewhere and where can I find it"" (the answer is no, we don't, so I need to go meet with engineering to set it up).
* Finally, our leadership has constantly pivoted business models during the time I've been here. I get that we're in tough times and startups need to be flexible, but at this point, the product is pretty different from what it was when I came in, and I'm not that excited about it anymore. So there isn't even motivation from believing in the product anymore.

I've been thinking a lot about this and feel like I should probably quit my job and find a new one where I am a bit better supported and can have some more mentorship. This is only my second job out of college, and while I've learned a lot from being the only person in this role, I think I want to be in an environment where I can get some more direct guidance - often, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is anywhere near what's considered ""best practice"". But I'd feel bad about just completely ditching the company. My coworkers are so nice, and I'm the only person who knows both our database and our BI platform well enough to generate reports/dashboards efficiently, so I think it would be very bad if I just quit one day, even with a two-week notice.

Any advice on how to deal with this situation?

As soon as I saw how stable the generation of the filter was, I started experimenting with it and trying to figure out how they did it.

My current belief is as follows. They manually hooked up the features from their face detection/recognition algo into an anime face GAN.  So you can think of as those sliders that control age/hair colour/skin colour on the face generation website but hooked up to features from facial recognition.

SC definitely has singled out which algo features correspond to which facial features because they use hair colour/length in other filters.

This approach leads to the more generic anime faces seen in the filter, but is way more stable than something like https://selfie2anime.com/ that does image-to-image conversion.

Aside from that, the filter just does a simple posterisation and overlays the face in the right spot.

Without any announcement (that i could find) google has increased the pricing per month of all its Colab Pro tiers, Pro is now 95 Euro and Pro+ is 433 Euro. I paid 9.99 Euro for the Pro tier last month... and all source i can find also refer to the 9.99 pricing as late as September last year. I have also checked that this is not a ""per year"" subscription price, it is in fact per month.

I looked at the VM that Colab Pro gives me and did the calculation for a similar VM in google cloud (4 vCPUs, 15GB RAM and a T4 GPU) running 24/7 for a month (Google calculates it as 730  hours). 

It costs around 290 Euro, less than the Colab Pro+ subscription... 

The 100 credits gotten from the Colab Pro subscription would only last around 50 hours on the same machine! 

And the 500 credits from Colab Pro+ would get 250 hours on that machine, a third of the time you get from using Google Cloud, at over 100 euro more....

This is a blatant ripoff, and i will certainly cancel my subscription right now if they don't change it back.

nqnrs6,datascience,1622646072.0,"Unlimited PTO (paid-time-off). Some love it, others think it’s a scam.

But it’s worth exploring why this policy was implemented in the first place. And for that, we go back to the early days at Netflix.

It’s 2003. Netflix is galloping along in pursuit of Blockbuster. There’s a buzz around the office. The chase is on and an employee asks:

*""'We are all working online some weekends, responding to emails at odd hours, taking off an afternoon for personal time. We don't track hours worked per day or week. Why are we tracking days of vacation per year?""*

Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, doesn’t really have a great answer. After all, he’s always judged performance without looking at hours. Get the job done in 1 hour or 10 hours? Doesn’t matter as long as you're doing good work.

Hastings also realizes that some of the best ideas at work come after someone’s just taken vacation. They’ve got the mental bandwidth to think about their work in a fresh, creative manner. Something that’s not possible if you’re clocking in and out without any rest.

So Hastings decides to pull the trigger. He introduces Netflix’s *No Vacation Policy* which puts the onus on their employees to decide when and how much vacation they need to take.

In his book, *No Rules Rules*, Hastings describes getting nightmares when he first introduced this policy. In one of these nightmares, he’d drive to the office, park his car, and walk into a completely empty building.

Those nightmares, minus a few blips which we’ll get to in a bit, never really materialized. The policy was a success and soon other companies in the Valley started copying Netflix. Everybody wanted the best talent and implementing a no rules vacation policy seemed like a great differentiator.

Except that the same policy which worked so well for Netflix...wasn’t working for anyone else.

Other companies found that after implementing an unlimited PTO type policy, employees paradoxically started to take *less* vacation. They would worry that their co-workers would think they were slacking off or that they would get left behind come promotion time.

Hastings was surprised. After a bit of digging, he realized the reason behind why these policies had failed.

The leaders at these companies were not modelling big vacation taking.

Indeed, if the execs were only taking 10 days off, then the unlimited plan would deter other employees from taking anywhere near that amount or more than that.

As Hastings put it:

*“In the absence of a policy, the amount of vacation people take largely reflects what they see their boss and colleagues taking.”*

**Modelling others around you**

This concept of modelling others around us applies not only to vacation taking, but to all sorts of behaviors. As we continue to move towards a new distributed, remote-first workforce, there’s going to be a lot of ambiguity in the decisions that we need to make.

The companies that are able to best adapt to this changing environment will be the ones in which leaders model the right set of behaviors.

A big one will be written communication. As the ability to just randomly walk up to someone at the office and ask them a question subsides, we’ll need to document our practices much better and be able to communicate much more efficiently.

The more we see others, especially our leaders, invest in written communication and take the time to get better at it, the more we will do it.

And never mind us seeing them do this. Reed Hastings wants them to shout loud and clear just how much vacation they’re taking or just how much they’re investing in themselves, so as to encourage everyone else to do it.

An example of good modelling in practice is Evernote. The company, which also doesn’t limit employee vacation days, actually gives a $1,000 stipend to anyone who takes an entire week off in order to encourage vacation taking ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2013/08/13/the-catch-of-having-an-unlimited-vacation-policy/)).

**Other Things**

Okay, so there was one more thing that Reed Hastings found out. It wasn’t enough for leaders to just model the right behavior. They also had to set context and guidelines.

Reed realized this when it was the end of quarter and his accounting team was supposed to be closing up their financial books. But a member of the team, in an attempt to avoid the annual crunch period, took off the first two weeks of January. No bueno.

So Reed decided to put in place clear parameters and guidelines on what was acceptable within the context of taking time off. For example, it was imperative to mention things like how many people taking time off at the same time is acceptable and how managers must be notified well in advance of any such long vacations.

This would help prevent blows like the one above in the accounting department.

**Conclusion**

In the end, it seems like Unlimited PTO can work, but it also needs to be supported with strong management. Individuals need to model big vacation taking and put into place the right guidelines.

But I think the lessons here go beyond just vacation.

The behaviors we see and notice from those around us eventually have a strong impact on the type of people that we become. This is especially true at the managerial level, where the impact is 1 to N and can result in considerable [cultural debt](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/cultural-debt).

So just like this question of unlimited vacation, the answer usually lies in its implementation. Context is king. But that does't always make for good headlines, now, does it.

n9aj13,datascience,1620667019.0,"The data science interview process is something that we have seen evolve over the last 5-10 years, taking on several shapes and hitting specific fads along the way. Back when DS got popular, the process was a lot like every other interview process - questions about your resume, some questions about technical topics to make sure that you knew what a person in that role should know, etc.

Then came the ""well, Google asks people these weird, seemingly nonsensical questions and it helps them *understand how you think!"".* So that became the big trend - how many ping pong balls can you fit into this room, how many pizzas are sold in Manhattan every day, etc.

Then came the behavioralists. Everything can be figured out by asking questions of the format ""tell me about a time when..."".

Then came leetcode (which is still alive).

Then came the FAANG ""product interview"", which has now bred literal online courses in how to pass the product interview.

I hit the breaking point of frustration a week ago when I engaged with a recruiter at one of these companies and I was sent a link to several medium articles to prepare for the interview, including one with a line so tone-deaf (not to be coming from the author of the article, but to be coming from the recruiter) that it left me speechless:

>As I describe my own experience, I can’t help thinking of a **common misconception** I often hear: it’s not possible to gain the knowledge on product/experimentation without real experience. I firmly disagree. I did not have any prior experience in product or A/B testing, but I believed that those skills could be gained by reading, listening, thinking, and summarizing. 

I'll stop here for a second, beacause I know I'm going to get flooded hate. I agree  - you can 100% acquire enough knowledge about a topic to pass ""know"" enough to pass a screening. However, there is always a gap between knowing something on paper and in practice - and in fact, that is *exactly* the gap that you're trying to quantify during an interview process.  

And this is the core of my issue with interview processes of this kind: if the interview process is one that a person can prepare for, then what you are evaluating people on isn't their ability to the job - you're just evaluating them on their ability to prepare for your interview process. And no matter how strong you think the interview process is as a proxy for that person's ability to do the actual job, the more efficiently someone can prepare for the interview, the weaker that proxy becomes.

To give an analogy - I could probably get an average 12 year old to pass a calculus test without them ever actually understanding calculus if someone told me in advance what were the 20 most likely questions to be asked. If I know the test is going to require taking the derivative of 10 functions, and I knew what were the 20 most common functions, I can probably get someone to get 6 out of 10 questions right and pass with a C-. 

It's actually one of the things that instructors in math courses always try (and it's not easy) to accomplish - giving questions that are not foreign enough to completely trip up a student, while simultaneously different enough to not be solvable through sheer memorization. 

As others have mentioned in the past, part of what is challenging about designing interview processes is controlling for the fact that most people are bad at interviewing. The more scripted, structured, rigid the interview process is, the easier it is to ensure that interviewers can execute the process correctly (and unbiasedly).

The problem - the trade-off - is that in doing so you are potentially developing a really bad process. That is, you may be sacrificing accuracy for precision. 

Is there a magical answer? Probably not. The answer is probably to invest more time and resources in ensuring that interviewers can be equal parts unpredictable in the nature of their questions and predictable in how they execute and evaluate said questions. 

But I think it is very much needed to start talking about how this process is likely broken - and that the quality of hires that these companies are making is much more driven by their brand, compensation, and ability to attract high quality hires than it is by filtering out the best ones out of their candidate pool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n9aj13/rant_if_your_companys_interview_process_can_be/,"Rant: If your company's interview process can be ""practiced"" for, it's probably not a very good one",,380,97,0.94

og48q2,MachineLearning,1625738970.0,"I have been observing AI/ML ethics research and discussions for over a year now and I have come to the conclusion that most work conducted in this area is deeply unethical.

All entities, let it be companies, institutions, and individuals, are subject to inherent **conflict-of-interests** that render any discussion meaningless.

AI/ML ethics does not generate any profits, making funding source for research or even ethics policies scarce. As a result, there are only a handful of entities working on this domain, which in turn have full control over how the entire field is moving. For instance, the ethics PC of NeurIPS 2020 was a single person (a British man) employed by DeepMind, making him/DM the ultimate arbiter of truth on AI ethics.

AI/ML ethics discussions are centered on domestic problems of the US. For instance, computer vision is becoming dominated by Chinese researchers (just look at this year's CVPR papers), whose approach to ethical values completely differ from the first. However, their views (and those of people from many other demographic groups) are not reflected by any AI/ML ethics rulings.

Finally, the way Timnit Gebru was treated by Google before and after she was kicked out is just unbearable for me. First of all, her paper is not a big deal, her claims are valid and do not threaten Google in any way. The way Google overreacted and even [published a counter paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10350v1.pdf) reveals that the conflict-of-interest I mentioned above runs much much deeper than I previously thought.

Nowadays when we see an AI/ML ethics paper funded by a company, we have to assume it went through several layers of filtering and censoring, putting it on a trustworthiness level on par with CCP propaganda. On top of that, even for papers without any company funding, we have to assume that a paper only resembles the views of a very tiny subset of the global population, because as I wrote, most demographical groups do not have access to funding for this topic and are therefore disregarded.

**TL;DL** an AI/ML ethics paper either reflects a company's interest or the beliefs of a very tiny subset of the earth's population

This paper, under review at ICLR, shows that given enough data, a standard Transformer can outperform Convolutional Neural Networks in image recognition tasks, which are classically tasks where CNNs excel. In this Video, I explain the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT), the reason why it works better and rant about why double-bline peer review is broken.

zk6h8q,MachineLearning,1670868433.0,">TL;DR: We paid USD $800 USD and spend 4 hours in the AWS Forecast console so you don't have to.

In this [reproducible experiment](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/tree/main/experiments/amazon_forecast), we compare [Amazon Forecast](https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/) and [StatsForecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) a python open-source library for statistical methods. 

Since AWS Forecast specializes in demand forecasting, we selected the [M5 competition](https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/m5-competition/) dataset as a benchmark; the dataset contains 30,490 series of daily Walmart sales.

**We found that Amazon Forecast is 60% less accurate and 669 times more expensive than running an open-source alternative in a simple cloud server.**

We also provide a step-by-step guide to [reproduce the results](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/aws/statsforecast.html).

### Results

**Amazon Forecast:**

* achieved 1.617 in error (measured in wRMSSE, the official evaluation metric used in the competition),
* took 4.1 hours to run,
* and cost 803.53 USD.

An **ensemble of statistical methods** trained on a c5d.24xlarge  EC2 instance:

* achieved 0.669 in error (wRMSSE),
* took 14.5 minutes to run,
* and cost only 1.2 USD.

For this data set, we show, therefore, that:

* Amazon Forecast is 60% less accurate and 669 times more expensive than running an open-source alternative in a simple cloud server.
* Classical methods outperform Machine Learning methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost.

Although using StatsForecast requires some basic knowledge of Python and cloud computing, the results are better for this dataset.

mgczg1,datascience,1617100586.0,"I had this happen twice during my 2 months of a job search. I am not sure if I am the problem and how to deal with it.

This is usually into multi-stage interview process when I have to present a technical solution or a case study. It's a week long take home task that I spend easily 20-30 hours on of my free time because I don't like submitting low quality work (I could finish it in 10 hours if I really did the bare minimum).

So after all this, I have to present it to a panel. Usually on my first or second slide, basically that just describes my background, someone cuts in. First time it happened, a most senior guy cut in and said that he doesn't think some of my research interests are exactly relevant to this role. I tried nicely to give him few examples of situations that they would be relevant in and he said ""Yeah sure but they are not relevant in other situations"". I mean, it's on my CV, why even let me invest all the time in a presentation if it's a problem? So from that point on, the same person interrupts every slide and derails the whole talk with irrelevant points. Instead of presenting what I worked so hard on, I end up feeling like I was under attack the entire time and don't even get to 1/3 of the presentation. Other panel members are usually silent and some ask couple of normal questions.

Second time it happened (today), I was presenting Kaggle type model fitting exercise. On my third slide, a panel member interrupts and asks me ""so how many of item x does out store sell per day on average?"" I said I don't know off the top of my head. He presses further: but how many? guess? I said ""Umm 15?"", He does ""that's not even close, see someone with retail data science experience would know that"". Again, it's on my CV that I don't have retail experience so why bother? The whole tone is snippy and hostile and it also takes over the presentation without me even getting to present technical work I did.

I was in tears after the interviews ended (I held it together during an interview). I come from a related field that never had this type of interview process. I am now hesitant to actually even apply to any more data science jobs. I don't know if I can spend 20-30 hours on a take home task again. It's absolutely draining.

Why do interviewers do that? Also, how to best respond? In another situation I would say ""hold your questions until the end of the presentation"". Here I also said that my preference is to answer questions after but the panel ignored it. I am not sure what to do.

iap6yo,MachineLearning,1597568347.0,"PyTorch packages (both pypi and conda packages) require the Intel MKL library. As you know, Intel MKL uses a slow code path on non-Intel CPUs such as AMD CPUs. There was the MKL\_DEBUG\_CPU\_TYPE=5 workaround to make Intel MKL use a faster code path on AMD CPUs, but it has been disabled since Intel MKL version 2020.1.

PyTorch relies on Intel MKL for BLAS and other features such as FFT computation. Because pypi and conda packages require Intel MKL, the only solution is to build PyTorch from source with a different BLAS library. However, it looks like this isn't really pain-free (e.g. see  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407)).

Moreover, if you look at issues like [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746) or  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412), it seems like they basically don't care about this problem.

Since PyTorch packages are slow by default on AMD CPUs and building PyTorch from source with a different BLAS library is also problematic, it seems like PyTorch is effectively protecting Intel CPUs from the ""ryzing"" of AMD's CPUs.

9p9ccz,MachineLearning,1539869890.0,"Soliciting thoughts on ML careers (in industry or academia), especially in light of machine learning and deep learning hype.

I work as an applied research engineer at a large non-tech company. Over the last few years ML has lost some of its luster in my mind - the hype around deep learning and ML has added a lot of noise into the system, and for someone who cares about doing good science that's been hard for me.

I feel like the effort I put into rigorous and reasoned application of ML is wasted and makes me less competitive - management wants the ""deep learning"" solution and they are satisfied by someone reading a blog post, throwing half-baked training data and Keras model.fit() at the problem and calling it solved. I'm not sure I can do ML in an environment like that, and it's difficult to push back against the seductive hype of ""cheap and easy"" deep learning (ironically a simple random forest would be much easier and often quite effective, but that isn't sexy. I've seen pressure to use neural networks even when something else makes much more sense to use). I love ML and like seeing others learn and be excited about it, but the low barrier to entry makes it easy for people to sell bad modeling to those who don't know any better.

How are you all enjoying your ML career? I'm considering moving away from ML and going back into software engineering, but maybe I just need to switch companies. Perhaps I'm just a curmudgeon or an idealist. Does anyone else have similar thoughts?

(Background: I have a masters in CS with a focus on machine learning. Since graduating a few years ago I've been working in an applied research role doing a 50/50 mix of software engineering and machine learning. I'm not particularly exceptional, but my company doesn't have a deep bench in AI/ML so I've become recognized as a subject-matter expert and could make a career out of researching and applying ML here.)

&#x200B;

EDIT:  This discussion has been great, thanks everyone. I realize that I should have been more explicit about what I meant by 'someone reading a blog post, throwing half-baked training data and Keras model.fit() at the problem and calling it solved' - I have no problem with quick and dirty work that gets the job done, but often what I see is unprincipled and haphazard application of ML in inappropriate ways. For example: not having a train/test set (particularly egregious), no thought given to overfitting or generality of results in production, etc. Between (1) management/customers not having the skillset to evaluate the methods, and (2) the hype around ML and deep learning, it seems to easy for subpar ML to get by if there isn't a clear feedback mechanism to expose poor models. I'm in favor of simple techniques and I definitely don't want to discourage people who are just starting out in ML - if you don't need sophisticated or rigorous methods to achieve good results that's great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9p9ccz/d_ml_is_losing_some_of_its_luster_for_me_how_do/,[D] ML is losing some of its luster for me.

Abstract:

Despite much progress in training AI systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce Cicero, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in *Diplomacy*, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. Cicero integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players' beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online *Diplomacy* league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game.

ilvkyi,MachineLearning,1599146919.0,"At the product announcement this week Nvidia released many new features for their next line of cards.

Many of us train and develop models running on Nvidia cards, and one new feature designed for gaming stood out to me.

The new Nvidia direct storage tech allows the GPU to load texture data directly from the SSD into the VRAM of the card without using the CPU. They indicate this can have massive 100x speed ups for data loading for video game textures etc.

For training large data models, often times loading and offloading data to the VRAM of the card is the biggest bottleneck for AI workloads. Loading training data, models, etc are often the slowest part of the pipeline when switching over from CPU to GPU compute. 

What do you think about this feature? Will it have a big impact on machine learning done locally? Should we buy new 3000 series cards for this feature alone?

ibrlvt,MachineLearning,1597714451.0,"Today Andrej Karpathy released code for a minimal gpt implementation ([here](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)), but what I found most interesting was his notes on the implementations. In particular at the end of the README he noted from the GPT-3 paper:
> GPT-3: 96 layers, 96 heads, with d_model of 12,288 (175B parameters).

> GPT-1-like: 12 layers, 12 heads, d_model 768 (125M)

> We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2, including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein

> we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer

> we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dff = 4 ∗ dmodel

> all models use a context window of nctx = 2048 tokens.

> Adam with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and eps = 10−8

> All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization. (NOTE: GPT-1 used 0.01 I believe, see above)

> clip the global norm of the gradient at 1.0

> Linear LR warmup over the first 375 million tokens. Then use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens.

> gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the first 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size.

> full 2048-sized time context window is always used, with a special END OF DOCUMENT token delimiter

It's baffling to me how they determined this learning rate schedule, in tandem with all of the other specific choices (7 hyperparameters + architecture)

My background is in deep RL research where iteration cost is pretty high (a training run may take several days to a week). Choosing the right hyperparameters is crucial to the success of algorithms, but thankfully, the complexity isn't so high that we can still run hyperparameter searches. In fact, many researchers, me included, observe that we can keep many parameters discovered from ""exhaustive"" search from other problems frozen and reduce the complexity of a search to a few key parameters like learning rate.


On the other hand, given the huge size of GPT-3 and the training costs, it is obvious that OpenAI researchers could not have done a hyperparameter search to get their results (a single training run probably cost millions.) So in this paradigm of absurd iteration cost, how do researchers determine the set of parameters that end up working? Is there interference during the training process (resetting at checkpoints and starting again?) Do you do hyperparameter searches for increasingly larger models and guess at the trend for what works at a larger scale? 

So my question is: how do you iterate when true iteration isn't possible? My own experience as a grad student has been ""intuition"" from working with the models, but I feel increasingly with these large scale successes / fragility of RL that the deep learning community needs a more principled approach to tackling these problems. Or maybe it's just an industry secret, in which case I rest my case :) 

Related is (again) Karpathy's work at Tesla, which also works on difficult iteration costs, but is more dealing with multi-task issues:

I wrote a review (see below), telling them that this is essentially a rehash of our previous work that LeCun did not mention. My comments, however, fell on deaf ears. Now I am posting my not so enthusiastic remarks here such that the history of our field does not become further corrupted.

*I would like to start this by acknowledging that I am not without a conflict of interest here; my seeking to correct the record will naturally seem self-interested. The truth of the matter is that it is. Much of the closely related work pointed to below was done in my lab, and I naturally wish that it be acknowledged, and recognized. Setting my conflict aside, I ask the reader to study the original papers and judge for themselves the scientific content of these remarks, as I seek to set emotions aside and minimize bias so much as I am capable.*

gh3v0q,datascience,1589125807.0,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly.

Hey r/ML,

Davit here from team Activeloop. My team and I have worked for over three years on our product, and we're excited to launch the latest, most performant iteration, Deep Lake.

Deep Lake is the data lake for deep learning applications. It retains all the benefits of a vanilla data lake, with one difference. Deep Lake is optimized to store complex data, such as images, videos, annotations, embeddings, & tabular data, in the form of tensors and rapidly streams the data over the network to (1) our lightning-fast query engine: Tensor Query Language, (2) in-browser visualization engine, and (3) deep learning frameworks without sacrificing GPU utilization.

[YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k)

[Detailed Launch post](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-the-data-lake-for-deep-learning/)

**Key features**

* A scalable & efficient data storage system that can handle large amounts of complex data in a columnar fashion
* Querying and visualization engine fully supporting multimodal data types (see the video)
* Native integration with TensorFlow & PyTorch and efficient streaming of data to models and back
* Seamless connection with MLOps tools (e.g., [Weight & Biases](https://docs.activeloop.ai/playbooks/training-reproducibility-with-wandb), with more on the roadmap)

**Performance benchmarks - (if you use PyTorch & audio/video/image, use us)**  
In an [independent benchmark of open-source data loaders by the Yale Institute For Network Science](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13705.pdf), Deep Lake was shown to be superior in various scenarios. For instance, there's only a 13% increase in time compared to loading from a local disk; Deep Lake outperforms all data loaders on networked loading, etc.).

**Example Workflow**

Here's a brief example of a workflow you're able to achieve with Deep Lake:

**Access Data Fast:** You start with CoCo, a fairly big dataset with 91 classes. You can load the COCO dataset in seconds by running:

    import deeplake
    ds = deeplake.load('hub://activeloop/coco-train')

**Visualize:** You can visualize the data either in-browser or within your Colab (with `ds.visualize`).

**Version Control:** Let's say you noticed that sample 30178, is a low-quality image, and you want to remove it:

    ds.pop(30178)
    ds.commit('Deleted index 30178 because the image is low quality.')

You can now revert the change any time, thanks to the git-like dataset version control.

**Query:** Suppose we want to train a model on small cars and trucks because we know our model performs poorly on small objects. In our Query UI, you can run advanced queries with built-in NumPy-like array manipulations, like:

[\(This would return up to 100 samples that contain trucks that are smaller than 50 pixels and up to 100 samples that contain cars that are smaller than 50 pixels\)](https://preview.redd.it/jkgl1vo8hmr91.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1054472e9f73623c6641fa5d5ba181d9c3e466d6)

You can then materialize the query result (Dataset View) by copying and re-chunking the data for maximum performance. You can save this query and load this subset via our Python API via

    import deeplake
    ds.load_view('Query_ID', optimize = True, num_workers = 4)

5.  **Materialize & Stream:** Finally, you can create the PyTorch data loader and stream the dataset in real-time while training the model that distinguishes cars from trucks:

    train_loader = ds_view.pytorch(num_workers = 8, shuffle = True, transform = transform_train, tensors = ['images', 'categories', 'boxes'], batch_size = 16, collate_fn = collate_fn)

You can review the rest of the code in this [data lineage playbook](https://docs.activeloop.ai/playbooks/training-with-lineage)!

Deep Lake is fresh off the ""press"", so we would really appreciate your feedback here or in our [community](https://slack.activeloop.ai), a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake). If you're interested to learn more, you can read the [Deep Lake academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10785.pdf) or the [whitepaper](https://deeplake.ai) (that talks more about our vision!).

Setting aside that possibly (and hopefully) this might never work outside of laboratory conditions, I think it's important to discuss the implications.

Personally, as a researcher, I find the AI field amazing (setting aside all the hype, bullshit and drama), and I think there's a huge responsibility in our hands to tip the balance between a utopian or dystopian future. For this reason I find this kind of research is extremely disturbing.

To quite from the article:

>... first author of the study, said: “We’re now looking to investigate how  we could use low-cost existing systems, such as Wi-Fi routers, to detect  emotions of a large number of people gathered, for instance in an  office or work environment.” Among other things, this could be useful  for HR departments to assess how new policies introduced in a meeting  are being received, regardless of what the recipients might say. Outside  of an office, police could use this technology to look for emotional  changes in a crowd that might lead to violence.  
>  
>The research team plans to examine public acceptance and ethical concerns around the use of this technology.  
>  
>....

Okey, so here comes the rant:

1. Yet another example of ""let's do something and then see the ethical concerns later"".
2. If your second statement about your research (right after stating that it is possible) is not about how to prevent this from being misused on a large scale, but rather proposing possible ways to apply this to benefit corporations, anti-protest forces and alike, then seriously, just fuck off and apply to a grant in North Korea.
3. They even say that they are actively looking into how this could be used with low-cost existing systems (e.g. Wi-Fi routers, etc.). These devices are in almost every western household, which is supposed to be a safe-space for fuckin everyone. How do you justify your work and call it beneficial for society?
4. There's a new article almost every week about a company or government body violating people's privacy in some way using technology. Yet, some researchers want to find better ways to do it, which shows that their moral compass doesn't work at all or they actively want to push things in the wrong direction. Whichever it is, you should stop what you're doing all together.
5. Of course, I see potential benefits to help people with depression, etc., but there are other ways that doesn't involve dystopian mind-reading technology put in your home or office.

Let me know what you think (or just get a device that reads your mind), I might be missing something obvious here.

Edit: just to make it absolutely clear, this is not a discussion about the technical side of the research, which may or may not be garbage (it's irrelevant here). This is a discussion about the attitude of researchers who don't seem to understand that just because they can do something does not mean that they actually should.

Edit 2: I don't assume bad intentions from the authors, simply questioning how is it acceptable to work on such a sensitive topic without **prior** and **thorough** ethical considerations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m7tfva/d_thoughtdetection_with_ai_honestly_wtf/,"[D] Thought-detection with AI (honestly, wtf?)",Discussion,362,150,0.91
ioa9za,MachineLearning,1599494999.0,"NVIDIA claims the 3080 has 238 ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’ of performance from their tensor cores, the 3090 has 285, and the 3070 has 163. As usual, these numbers are for 16-bit floating point. In contrast, the 2080 Ti has only 114 TFLOPS of ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’, so you would be forgiven for thinking the 30 series will be much faster at training.

Alas, the values for the 30 series are *TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity*, not actual TFLOPS. Ampere has support for ‘2:4 structured sparsity’, which accelerates matrix multiplications where half of the values in every block of four are zeroed. This means that the actual number of TFLOPS for the 3080, 3090 and 3070 are 119, 143, and 81.

When Ampere originally launched on the A100, NVIDIA was [very clear](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/a100/#specifications) about differentiating real TFLOPS from TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity. It is incredibly disappointing that NVIDIA have been not at all upfront about this with their new GeForce GPUs. This is made worse by the fact that the tensor cores have been cut in half in the GeForce line relative to the A100, so it is easy to get confused into thinking the doubled numbers are correct.

Although hardware sparsity support is a great feature, it obviously only provides benefits when you are training or running inference on a sparsified network.

I'm the only member of the DS team at my company at the moment and we just had someone leave who was primarily in Python. Some of his code broke and now I'm having to troubleshoot it. I can't make heads or tails. With my R code things are basically sequential and you can tell what's happening by searching object names and following changes to those objects. Whenever I look at my colleagues' python code it rarely resembles that. And it's cumbersome to run pieces of code and see where it's breaking. In R I can easily run this piece, then the next piece, then look inside constituent functions.

I've also never seen anything in my colleagues' code that resembles tidyverse. I'm ridiculously more efficient in data munging than I was in base R. Most of my data comes from the wild and cleaning data seems like a nightmare in Python. It could just be a skillset thing, but my when my Python colleagues would be responsible for cleaning data I would regularly find some troubling errors. I can't help but think it may have to do with the tool they're using.

My other gripe is environments. My old boss had some great projects, but the shit rarely runs for me. I spend a huge amount of time trying to set up the appropriate environments.

A more constructive question is how can I get my hands around this? Any time I sit down to learn Python I spend a lot of time on minor concepts that I would likely pick up anyway. After a few weeks I'm so bored that when other things come up I just drop it. The way I learned R involved adapting other people's code and understanding how it works. I'd pick apart something advanced and figure out simpler concepts as a part of that process. I have a ton of Python code available to me that's relevant to my job but I can't get it to run at all, much less truly understand it and build my own version.

f5immz,MachineLearning,1581985180.0,"A new [story](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615181/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/) by journalist [Karen Hao](https://mobile.twitter.com/_KarenHao/status/1229519114638589953) who spent six months digging into OpenAI.

She started with a few simple questions: Who are they? What are their goals? How do they work? After nearly three dozen interviews, she found so much more.

The article is worth a read. I'm not going to post an excerpt here.

The most surprising thing is that Elon Musk himself, after that article got published, [criticized](https://www.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1229544673590599681) OpenAI and tweeted that they ""should be more open"" 🔥

With regards to AI safety, Elon [said](https://www.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1229546206948462597) ""I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high.""

ydqmjp,MachineLearning,1666764648.0,"We are releasing [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) under Apache 2 license, a library to make PyTorch models inference significantly faster. With 1 line of code we applied the optimizations and made Bert up to 12X faster than Hugging Face baseline. T5 is also covered in this first release (> 6X speed up generation and we are still halfway in the optimizations!). This has been possible because we wrote custom GPU kernels with the new OpenAI programming language Triton and leveraged TorchDynamo.

**Project link**: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/)

**E2E demo notebooks**: [XNLI classification](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/bert%20e2e.ipynb), [T5 generation](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/t5%20e2e.ipynb)

[Benchmarks ran on a 3090 RTX GPU, 12 cores Intel CPU, more info below](https://preview.redd.it/mlo3wvn0d3w91.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f71bfc9cbbb4af2fd3fe7dedf5afd8f9b7c4603e)

On long sequence length inputs, [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) is most of the time the fastest inference engine, and close to Nvidia TensorRT on shortest ones. Keep in mind that Bert is one of the most optimized models out there and most of the tools listed above are very mature.

What is interesting is not that [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) is the fastest engine (or not), but that the code of the kernels is short and easy to understand and modify. We have even added a Triton debugger and a tool (based on Fx) to ease kernel replacement so there is no need to modify PyTorch model source code.

Staying in the comfort of PyTorch / Python maintains dynamic behaviors, debugging and iteration speed. Teams designing/training a transformer model (even custom) can take care of the deployment without relying on advanced GPU knowledge (eg. CUDA programming, dedicated inference engine API, etc.).

Recently released models relying on slightly modified transformer architectures are rarely accelerated in traditional inference engines, we need to wait months to years for someone (usually inference engine maintainers) to write required custom CUDA kernels. Because here custom kernels are written in OpenAI Triton language, **anyone without CUDA experience** can easily modify them: OpenAI Triton API is simple and close to Numpy one. Kernels source code is significantly shorter than equivalent implementation in CUDA (< 200 LoC per kernel). Basic knowledge of how GPU works is enough. We are also releasing a few tutorials we initially wrote for onboarding colleagues on the project. We hope you will find them useful: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/tree/main/tutorial](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/tree/main/tutorial). In particular, there is:

* Tiled matmul, the GPU way to perform matmul: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/1%20-%20tiled%20matmul.ipynb](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/1%20-%20tiled%20matmul.ipynb)
* Simple explanation of what Flash attention is and how it works, a fused attention making long sequences much faster: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/4%20-%20flash%20attention.ipynb](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/blob/main/tutorial/4%20-%20flash%20attention.ipynb)

And best of the best, because we stay in the PyTorch / Python ecosystem, we plan in our roadmap to also enable **training** with those custom kernels. In particular [Flash attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) kernel should bring a 2-4X speed up and the support of very long sequences on single GPU (paper authors went as far as 16K tokens instead of traditional 512 or 2048 limits)! See below for more info.

**IMPORTANT**: Benchmarking is a difficult art, we tried to be as fair as possible. Please note that:

* Timings are based on wall-clock times and we show speedup over baseline as they are easier to compare between input shapes,
* When we need to choose between speed and output precision, we always choose precision
* HF baseline, CUDA graphs, Inductor and [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) are in mixed precision, AITemplate, ONNX Runtime, DeepSpeed and TensorRT have their weights converted to FP16.
* Accumulation is done in FP32 for AITemplate and [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/). TensorRT is likely doing it in FP16.
* CUDA graphs is enabled for all engines except baseline, Nvfuser and ONNX Runtime which [has a limited support of it](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/12977#issuecomment-1258406358).
* For [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) and AITemplate, fast GELU has been manually disabled (TensorRT is likely using Fast GELU).
* AITemplate measures are to be taken with a grain of salt, it [doesn’t manage attention mask](https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate/issues/46#issuecomment-1279975463) which means 1/ batch inference can’t be used in most scenarios (no padding support), 2/ it misses few operations on a kernel that can be compute-bounded (depends of sequence length), said otherwise it may make it slower to support attention mask, in particular on long sequences. AITemplate attention mask support will come in a future release.
* For TensorRT for best perf, we built 3 models, one per batch size. AITemplate will support dynamic shapes in a future release, so we made a model per input shape.
* Inductor is in prototype stage, performances may be improved when released, none of the disabled by default optimizations worked during our tests.

As you can see, CUDA graphs erase all CPU overhead (Python related for instance), sometimes there is no need to rely on C++/Rust to be fast! Fused kernels (in CUDA or Triton) are mostly important for longer input sequence lengths. We are aware that there are still some low hanging fruits to improve [Kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/) performance without sacrificing output precision, it’s just the first release. More info about how it works [here](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl#how).

**Why?**

We work for Lefebvre Sarrut, a leading European legal publisher. Several of our products include transformer models in latency sensitive scenarios (search, content recommendation). So far, ONNX Runtime and TensorRT served us well, and we learned interesting patterns along the way that we shared with the community through an open-source library called [transformer-deploy](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy). However, recent changes in our environment made our needs evolve:

* New teams in the group are deploying transformer models in prod directly with PyTorch. ONNX Runtime poses them too many challenges (like debugging precision issues in fp16). With its inference expert-oriented API, TensorRT was not even an option;
* We are exploring applications of large generative language models in legal industry, and we need easier dynamic behavior support plus more efficient quantization, our creative approaches for that purpose we shared [here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uwkpmt/p_what_we_learned_by_making_t5large_2x_faster/) proved to be more fragile than we initially thought;
* New business opportunities if we were able to train models supporting large contexts (>5K tokens)

On a more personal note, I enjoyed much more writing kernels and understanding low level computation of transformers than mastering multiple complicated tools API and their environments. It really changed my intuitions and understanding about how the model works, scales, etc. It’s not just OpenAI Triton, we also did some prototyping on C++ / CUDA / Cutlass and the effect was the same, it’s all about digging to a lower level. And still the effort is IMO quite limited regarding the benefits. If you have some interest in machine learning engineering, you should probably give those tools a try.

**Future?**

Our road map includes the following elements (in no particular order):

* Faster warmup
* Ragged inference (no computation lost in padding)
* Training support (with long sequences support)
* Multi GPU (multiple parallelization schemas support)
* Quantization (PTQ)
* New batch of Cutlass kernels tests
* Improve hardware support (>= Ampere for now)
* More tuto

Regarding training, if you want to help, we have written an issue with all the required pointers, it should be very doable: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/issues/93](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/issues/93)

On top of speed, one of the main benefits is the support of very long sequences (16K tokens without changing attention formula) as it’s based on [Flash Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention).

Also, note that future version of PyTorch will include [Inductor](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-a-pytorch-native-compiler-with-define-by-run-ir-and-symbolic-shapes/747). It means that all PyTorch users will have the option to compile to Triton to get around [1.7X faster training](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-update-3-e2e-model-training-with-torchdynamo-inductor-gets-1-67x-2-1x-speedup/793).

leh0ve,datascience,1612678910.0,"TL;DR Edit, because I'm seeing a few comments taking this in a bit of a binary way...the program is valuable and interesting and I don't regret doing it per se, AND there are parts which are needlessly frustrating and unacceptable for a degree that's existed for this long from as ostensibly prestigious a university; don't completely scratch all your higher-ed plans, but please be an informed and prepared buyer of your own education. 

Hi all. I'm a FAANG data engineer, former analyst (yes: I escaped the Analyst Trap, if not in the direction I thought/hoped I was going to, yet) and current student in the UC Berkeley Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program. I thought I'd do a little write up since I frequently see people asking about the pros and cons of these kind of programs. This is my personal experience (though definitely found other students share more than just a few of these experiences) so take with the customary salt grain.

The Good: The instructors are generally pretty good at explaining concepts, office hours are helpful, and projects are frequently relevant to what you \*might\* be doing on the job - or in a lab. The available courseload runs the gamut from serious statistics & causal inference (which you might...want to know if you ever plan on running an A/B test, much less a clinical trial) to machine learning *as implemented via distributed computing*/*in the cloud*, which is probably more realistic and practical in some cases than building yourself a whole model on your, I don't know, lenovo work laptop. There's an NLP course that gets good (if shell-shocked) reviews. Lots of decent people. Career services is actually quite helpful when they can be. Your student success advisor is almost certainly a damn saint; while they can't wave a magic wand to solve your problems, they will try to get you resources and advice you may need. Be nice to them.

The Bad: Berkeley...doesn't know how to run a smooth online data science class, evidently. The logistics are often messy. I've seen issues with git repos that arbitrarily prevented downloading necessary materials, major assumptions made on assignments about students prior experience (not like ""you've taken some math before"" - like ""you know how to do bash scripting,"" which is something that, more reasonably, a large % of people might genuinely have never really touched). Recordings of office hours that...don't show the screenshare, leaving you to *guess* at what's going on & follow along just by listening. Errors/typos in homework assignments as given. At one point we were running an experiment and promised up to $500 reimbursement - I paid OOP and then, as it turns out, reimbursement takes *into the next semester.* The instructor didn't even *know* when it would happen, or how, when I asked - so weeks, and weeks, of waiting to be reimbursed for a good half a k, with no good communication or clarity. Instructors are sometimes handed a class with built out materials & not prepared or provided any real familiarization with the materials as extant. In the course I am in now, there is someone dedicated to helping out w infrastructure...who has exactly 1 OH a week, which happens to be (mostly) *during an actual section,* with the aforementioned recording problem so heaven help you if you miss one and it's a time-sensitive issue that, for instance, is blocking your homework. I've seen at least 1 case where we were supposed to have 2wks to work on an assignment. Instructors forgot to upload the data needed for the HW until half a week after my section and didn't change the due date, meaning the weekend section(s) had the full two weeks, de facto, while we had less. I had to *ask* for the due date to be moved back, and even then *they didn't actually give our section the full time.* And dragged their feet making any decision about it at all. So...directly advantaging one or sections over others? Fun!

In general, the subject matter is fascinating and well-explained - when you get a chance to ask - and *most* of the classes I've taken have been fun, interesting, rewarding, and relevant - not always to my job right *now*, but certainly to \* some permutation\* of the broader data science role. It's definitely an intro - you're not gonna graduate from a 2yr degree as an objective expert in such a complex field - but it goes a hell of a lot deeper and touches on more relevant stuff than your average non-degree program would, I think. With that said, It can feel as if you're (expected to be) learning IT 202 on top of data science - which is a fine and important subject, but my attitude is it is 100% not what I paid for and not my job to be the unpaid Quality Assurance staff on the ""Online Masters"" Project, and this represents a profound failure of the school administration and, sadly, some of the instructors to treat their students fairly. It remains to be seen whether the whole masters is ""worth it"" - but I can honestly say that this semester and one of the others really are/were not, in my opinion, worth what I paid for them. At 8000+ dollars a class, *the school and/or the instructor better get it right.* And fix it if it's going wrong. So far, they...don't. My advisor is great, and highly sympathetic. But I haven't really seen any effort by the school administration or instructors to better the experience. As with most higher education, let the buyer beware: your experience will be more rewarding the more you expect and assume to be walking into a mess - but sadly, if you don't have enough time to start every assignment abominably early so you can ask every possible question / resolve any possible issue, make all the office hours you could possibly need to, and find the perfect group of study buddies, you're going to have some rough semesters.

&#x200B;

Not exactly dropping out of the degree, and I do feel it's ultimately valuable, but it's certainly dragging on a bit, and becoming more a game of ""how do I best compensate for the lack of communication, poor communication, and unacceptably disorganized infrastructure that I am almost certainly going to have to deal with"" than ""how do I learn this challenging and complex concept.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/leh0ve/data_science_masters_the_good_the_bad_the_ugly/,"Data Science Masters - The Good, the Bad, The Ugly",Education,362,212,0.97

I have built a RNN with transformer-level performance, without using attention. Moreover it supports both sequential & parallel mode in inference and training. So it's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, saves VRAM, fast training, ""infinite"" ctx\_len, and free sentence embedding.

[https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)

I am training a L24-D1024 RWKV-v2-RNN LM (430M params) on the Pile with very promising results:

**All of the trained models will be open-source.** Inference is very fast (only matrix-vector multiplications, no matrix-matrix multiplications) even on CPUs, and **I believe you can run a 1B params RWKV-v2-RNN with reasonable speed on your phone.**

It is inspired by Apple's AFT ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14103)) with a number of my own tricks, such as:

* RNNify it (via a particular nice form of w\_{t, t\^\\prime}), and use my CUDA kernel to speedup training ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-CUDA](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-CUDA))
* Token-shift ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#token-shift-time-shift-mixing](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#token-shift-time-shift-mixing))
* SmallInitEmb ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/SmallInitEmb](https://github.com/BlinkDL/SmallInitEmb)) which helps the embedding quality, and stabilizes Post-LN (which is what I am using).

I also transferred some time-related parameters from a small model to a large model, to speed up the convergence. Basically the model learns to focus more on short-distance interactions in early layers, and long-distance interactions in later layers.

tgd8ce,datascience,1647532116.0,"Context: I just completed the process of hiring for a Jr. DS role. We had \~100 applications in one week. I personally read every resume because it's the first time I am working with this recruiter and needed to establish some alignment around what we're looking for. This isn't for a FAANG-type company - we're a sizable company, we're somewhere in tech, but we're not a creme de la creme-type company. 

First of all, some general observations:

* \~70% of applications were from people with an MS in DS
* \~70% of applications required H1B sponsorship
* The most common applicant profile was someone with a BS in something technical from a foreign school, who had then gotten an MS in DS from a somewhat reputable program in the US and would require H1B sponsorship.
* \~20% of applicants had some real world experience in data science
* The final slate of candidates were: 
   * Someone with a research-based MS degree in STEM from a very good US school where they had done ML work.
   * Someone with an MS in DS that already had experience in DS post-graduation
   * Someone with a BS and MS in math/quantitative finance/economics from a very good US school with several strong internships

Some general comments:

1. I see a lot of people (and I did when I was an entry-level applicant) who take the mindset of ""hey, I'm plenty smart for this role. I know I can learn what I need to learn to contribute, so why is no one giving me a chance?"". The answer has less to do with you and more to do with the fact that you're competing with 150 other people. And some of them have a fundamentally stronger background than you. So you need to change your mindset - when you get rejected, it's not because you're not good enough for the job. It's because there is just someone better.
2. If you do not need H1B sponsorship, make that clearly obvious in your resume. Especially if you have a foreign name (like me), degrees from a foreign university, etc. Don't give anyone any reason to asssume that you may need H1B sponsorship. Also - OPT doesn't count. Don't tell a recruiter that you don't need sponsorship to then tell them you're on OPT so you won't need sposorship for the next 3 years. That's just wasting everyone's time. Companies are either ok hiring F1 students or not. 
3. As an entry-level candidate, your focus should **not** be on portraying yourself as someone who knows everything - both on your resume and in person. That is, if you are an entry-level candidates, you cannot - almost by definition - be strong in every area of DS. Because of that, instead of trying to hype up every angle to look like a perfect candidate, in my experience you are better off picking your true strengths and doubling down on those - and being transparent as to where your weaknesses lie. For example - the most common one for fresh grads is not having real world experience working in a business environment. Don't try to convince me that your 3 month internship made you an expert in dealing with stakeholders. You're just wasting time. Instead, tell me ""yeah, I have limited experience in a real-world setting, but I'm really excited to jump into that environment and learn what I need to contribute"". 
4. You don't need an objective in your resume, *unless* you are making a career pivot or took an unconventional path to DS. If you got a MS in e.g. Sociology, but you did a lot of ML work in that progam, then you *have* to include that in an up-front statement. You can't wait for someone to get through your entire resume to figure that out. Why? Because you get 6-10 seconds to convince me that I should keep reading your resume. So if in those 10 seconds I did not see something that tells me ""yes, this story makes sense for a data scientist"", I am going to move on. Same if you're moving from a tangentially related role - you're going to want to explain up-front why I should believe that you can make that transition.
5. Stick to one page. If you're an entry-level candidate, there is no reason to have 2 pages. Again, it just makes it more likely that the person reading it will miss something you wanted them to see.
6. Along those lines - make the information that you think makes the best case for your candidacy easy to spot in your resume. To me, that breaks down into two options:
   1. If your education is strongest, put your education first, followed by your work experience.
   2. If your work experience is strong, put work experience first and put your education at the end (where it's easy to find). 
7. Do not shy away from listing non-DS or non-STEM experience. If you have limited work experience in DS, but spent 3 years working as a Manager at Applebees while in college? I want to know that. That tells me several things about you - firstly, that you worked during college. Secondly, that you have experience managing clients. Thirdly, that you have experience working in a chaotic environment. Short of telling me you have an onlyfans business, almost all experience is worth listing.
8. When listing team projects, please list what *you* worked on. Don't give me the broad description - focus on what you did.
9. Generaly speaking, there are two things that will make a hiring manager interested in you: experience, or potential. So, if I have candidate A who has solid experience doing what I need someone in this role to do, the way a different candidate B can have a chance without having that experience is to convince me that (obviously with some onboarding/training) they could be an even better candidate than A if given time. That will normally rely on candidate B having done really impressive things - whether it's in the classroom, research, internships, etc.

9symfk,MachineLearning,1540991779.0,"I'm trying to reverse-engineer a huge neural network. The problem is, it's essentially a blackbox. The creator has left no documentation, and the code is obfuscated to hell.

Some facts that I've managed to learn about the network:

* it's a recurrent neural network
* it's huge: about 10\^11 neurons and about 10\^14 weights
* it takes 8K Ultra HD video (60 fps) as the input, and generates text as the output (100 bytes per second on average)
* it can do some image recognition and natural language processing, among other things

I have the following experimental setup:

* the network is functioning about 16 hours per day
* I can give it specific inputs and observe the outputs
* I can record the inputs and outputs (already collected several years of it)

Assuming that we have Google-scale computational resources, is it theoretically possible to successfully reverse-engineer the network? (meaning, we can create a network that will produce similar outputs giving the same inputs) .

How many years of the input/output records do we need to do it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9symfk/d_reverseengineering_a_massive_neural_network/,[D] Reverse-engineering a massive neural network,Discussion,360,152,0.89

TL;DR The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, styled as BAAI and known in Chinese as 北京智源人工智能研究院, launched the latest version of Wudao 悟道, a pre-trained deep learning model that the lab dubbed as “China’s first,” and “the world’s largest ever,” with a whopping 1.75 trillion parameters.

And the corresponding twitter thread: https://twitter.com/DavidSHolz/status/1399775371323580417

What's interesting here is BAAI is funded in part by the China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, which is China's equivalent of the NSF. The equivalent of this in the US would be for the NSF allocating billions of dollars a year *only to train models*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/npzqks/r_chinese_ai_lab_challenges_google_openai_with_a/,"[R] Chinese AI lab challenges Google, OpenAI with a model of 1.75 trillion parameters",Research,366,182,0.89
hbxj93,datascience,1592558308.0,"I have had some experience working as a machine learning engineer but if I am honest with myself, I barely did much. I am 24 with 2 years of experience. Got laid off, rightfully so.

I have been struggling with myself and I keep on preparing, studying... But the result is a loop of painful rejections. You know, the kind of rejections where the company was interested in you, set the bar reasonably not high and expected me to pass through it

&#x200B;

And yet I didn't. My profile looks good on paper but I feel like a fraud. Like someone who can try all he wants to but let's be honest, who is he kidding ? He doesn't know shit. He can't take up REAL responsibilities without having someone look over his shoulder. And even then he is lazy, mediocre.

Tried doing projects, watching videos, kaggle (that's a lie, I tried like 2 or 3 competitions that too I followed what others did)

I guess the gist of it is that I think I am a fraud. A phony. **I can have the bookish knowledge but I will forget it when I need it or would be unable to apply it.**

I'll never have what it takes to be an actual data scientist. It is just an unsophisticated fantasy.  And at the same I don't see myself doing anything else so I guess I am useless to the society\~ No one will hire me cause I can do nothing.

Just wanted to let it out after yet another disastrous interview which I knew everything about(as in, the answers to the questions), yet I messed it up. They threw a low ball and I missed my swing. Looked like a fool. & Now I am binging on the Office (TV show) to numb it up

I know this is true for reddit in general, most subs are quite pessimistic and it leaves a bitter taste in one's mouth.

Or is it just me? I'm working in analytics, planning to get a DS (or maybe BI) job soon and everytime I come here, I leave thinking ""I really should just keep studying and stop reading reddit"".

I've been studying DS related things for the past 3 years. I know it's a difficult field to get into and succeed in, but it can't be this bad... posts here make it seem like you need 20 years of experience for an entry level job... and then you'll hate it anyway, because you'll just be making graphs in Excel (I'm being slightly hyperbolic).

One way is probably reading pivotal papers, but I still find it a bit intimidating. Therefore, I'd love to find a book with good, but more theoretical explanations.

I have nowhere near that level of obsession. I'm worried that this may be a problem, as in maybe I'm not passionate enough about research to do great work in the area. I feel like if I had a near death experience during my PhD I would probably regret not doing a large variety of other fun things in life, instead of still thinking about research.

Thoughts on this? Do you think that the experience described by Goodfellow would be a common experience? Do you think everyone in ML research has a similar level of obsession?
